1079042100153466880 2018-12-29 10:50:58 EDT <WhalePanda> From the other side a lot of Bitcoiners looked at $ETH and saw how they never kept their promises "decentralized, uncensorable world computer" and they call it out. Many people went through the following "Bitcoin => all altcoins could be cool => some alts are cool => Bitcoin"
1079042099050438656 2018-12-29 10:50:58 EDT <WhalePanda> Now we're also in the Proof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake nonsense. All the attacks against PoW and calling it wasteful makes no sense, unless you're pushing an agenda. And lets not forget that Vitalik was the one what started calling people "Bitcoin maximalists" as a pejorative term

1077925133665427457 2018-12-26 08:52:33 EDT <WhalePanda> Even though development in Bitcoin might seem slow if you follow it day-to-day, you have to remember that a year ago we didn't even have LN yet on main net.  Developing cutting edge software takes time. There's no rush.  This approach is better than go fast and break things.
1077924657486053376 2018-12-26 08:50:39 EDT <NakamotoQuotes> The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin.

If you come at Bitcoin purely using econ, you'll just skim the surface. You need to go down to the engineering/biology level.  https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1077298151852191746¬†‚Ä¶

There is something deeply poetic about bitcoin being so powerful because of this power of truth, not authority.

1075738440711327744 2018-12-20 08:03:25 EDT <aurumbtc> Many of our smartest minds eschewing entrepreneurship or engineering or  medicine to enter "finance" is one of the great tragedies of our age,  leaving aside the capital misallocation.  Bitcoin offers a hope this  error can be corrected in future generations.

It enables a peaceful wealth transfer.  Violence only begets more violence, destroying wealth instead of transferring it.
1074886139604021249 2018-12-17 23:36:40 EDT <AnselLindner> People can withdrawal their consent of their rulers in violent protests or peaceful civil disobedience. Bitcoin, and more broadly cryptography, makes the latter far superior.

1074742017073262592 2018-12-17 14:03:59 EDT <PeterSchiff> Since Brian Kelly, a CNBC regular, just admitted to using his position as a CNBC regular to pump and dump Bitcoin, CNBC viewers who were duped into buying Bitcoin based on Kelly's table pounding bullishness, without disclosing his conflict, should be lawyering up. Look out CNBC!
1074740741749043200 2018-12-17 13:58:55 EDT <PeterSchiff> Brian Kelly, just revealed for the first time on #CNBC that he has been short Bitcoin.  Too bad he did not disclose this conflict as he was pumping Bitcoin up to the CNBC audience so he could dump the rally.  CNBC should apology to its audience and fire Kelly from their network!

Don't buy into the celebration. There is a lot more air yet to come out of this bubble.  I'm speaking about it today on Fox Business with @LizClaman.

It has 55% market dominance & will drag everything down unless huge news comes out for XRP. Might have a bounce before XRP 0.23,0.19,0.15.

1073709009805471744 2018-12-14 17:39:11 EDT <alansilbert> You don‚Äôt really understand much about Bitcoin I gather.
1073708990767362048 2018-12-14 17:39:06 EDT <tradingroomapp> /5  On the flip side, if 200 Week MA is breached on downside & we get couple of weekly closes below, it will be pretty much curtains for bulls for 2019 as well. #Bitcoin will languish in a sub 7300 range for bulk of 2019 if price indeed breach & close for several weeks below 200
1073708370652057600 2018-12-14 17:36:38 EDT <shit_rbtc_says> At least it hasn‚Äôt been this cheap to get into bitcoin for a while, and it‚Äôs going to get cheaper so the good news continues.
1073707906900447232 2018-12-14 17:34:48 EDT <tradingroomapp> /3  Traditionally 200 MA, delivers 161.8% or more pullback in smaller timeframes during strong trends  If the trend has weakened, 200 MA can be breached easily & doesn‚Äôt offer much of a fight  #Bitcoin is in uptrend as far as weekly chart is concerned  /4
1073706182844370944 2018-12-14 17:27:57 EDT <tradingroomapp> #Bitcoin 200 Week Moving Average is giving tough fight. Even if you do not understand technical analysis, it‚Äôs worth learning 200 MA as last line of defence for major assets. It works in all timeframes. It‚Äôs never to the dot & can breach briefly even if the level wants to hold.

1073673597296799744 2018-12-14 15:18:28 EDT <NakamotoQuotes> The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin.

1070848806579826690 2018-12-06 20:13:45 EDT <pierre_rochard> Normally in a currency devaluation crisis I would advise the issuer to tighten monetary policy, but this Bitcoin exchange rate crisis has one clear cause: BTC went from $200 to $20,000 in 2.5 years. Massive hyperdeflation, two orders of magnitude in the span of 30 months.

1070226408872574977 2018-12-05 03:00:34 EDT <saifedean> Bitcoin isn't "cool" or "awesome" new tech. It's an ugly contraption optimized to be neutral apolitical money, not for your user experience.  It's not the toy you want, it's the medicine you need. Like it or not, it's your best chance for living in a free market with sound money.

1070223509937422336 2018-12-05 02:49:03 EDT <saifedean> After a century of bloody failure, only an idiot could believe govt money can be apolitical. Gold is heavily controlled by govts. No altcoin can claim to be outside the control of the scammers who promote it.  There's only one neutral free market money in the planet: Bitcoin.
1070222967424970752 2018-12-05 02:46:53 EDT <Billfodl_Wallet> This is a public service announcement: stop telling people how much #bitcoin you own.

1070222393279438849 2018-12-05 02:44:36 EDT <saifedean> This is why all complaints about Bitcoin speed or capacity are ridiculously short-sighted. Even at a tenth of its current speed & capacity bitcoin is still the only neutral monetary system available. Unlike government fiat, a free market for capital can be built on top of bitcoin

1069378073471213568 2018-12-02 18:49:35 EDT <NickSzabo4> Bitcoin both (a) makes it very difficult to censor (requiring a risky and expensive fork among disparate miner and node stakeholders), and (b) backs that up with a strong ideology of immutability. XRP AFAIK falls far short on both these counts.

1069074556990705665 2018-12-01 22:43:31 EDT <cryptunez> Your goal should always be to get as much bitcoin as possible.   Trading is a good way to do this, but it still is just one method of many.
1069073904080162816 2018-12-01 22:40:55 EDT <jeetsidhu_> Governments are best when they‚Äôre extremely local.

Bitcoin removing the need to trust a central bank removes a massive security hole in human survival.

1068884708770136064 2018-12-01 10:09:08 EDT <nic__carter> The problem with taking the "chancellor on brink of bailout" inscription too seriously is that it leads to the assumption that Bitcoin's purpose is to destroy banks.

However, if none of this happens & price sinks below Nov 28 lows to $3,700, Bitcoin could fall to the $3,000 level.  https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/12/01/bitcoin-price-analysis-google-binance-verb-changpeng-zhao/¬†‚Ä¶
