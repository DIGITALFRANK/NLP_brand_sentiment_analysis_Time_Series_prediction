Seems like a big circle jerk. Which one is it for f@!k sake.  Why not just use Bitcoin BSV?

Those that do will be a privileged group.    Owning on chain is like owning bricks of gold in the 19th century. Not many did.

Remember that Bitcoin's base layer is intended to be a means of large value transfers that require a high degree of trust minimization.

Trend lines are fine. High time frame RSI is fine in a bull market. I'm looking at $2750(86% drop fractal) or $1175(revisit last peak), or $850 (overshoot last peak 30%)

That type of movement would match closely with the 2015 bottom, and it would respect multiyear rising support on the log chart.

1099580552804552706 2019-02-24 03:03:27 EDT <WhalePanda> True, can't do that with ETH/ETH because you don't know if it's ETH1.0/ETH1.0 or ETH1.0/ETH2.0 which obviously don't have the same value. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø And Bitcoin and XRP have a predictable monetary policy.

1099449888700432384 2019-02-23 18:24:14 EDT <Excellion> Ofc 1 BTC = 1 BTC alone doesn‚Äôt make for sound money. The point economists miss is that #Bitcoin is like a ruler. Finite supply allows us to measure other things. Fiat supply keeps growing, so measuring in $‚Äôs is meaningless.

1099444048480423941 2019-02-23 18:01:02 EDT <bitstein> Too many economists think price stability drives liquidity rather than  the other way around.

You are free to use bitcoin irresponsibly. Plus, lightning wallets have small balances. Compare that to the bitcoin left with custodians like binance and coinbase.

1097902351581626374 2019-02-19 11:54:53 EDT <_unwriter> It's a backend framework that makes it effortless to build APIs, just like Ruby on Rails or Django, but 100% powered by Bitcoin.   The entire backend fits into a single JavaScript module, which turns into an autonomous Docker container. All you need to know is JavaScript.

1097893335862267905 2019-02-19 11:19:03 EDT <TheBitfi> It is silly not to own 1 Bitcoin. Even if you foolishly believe that Bitcoin is going to zero, the remarkably asymmetrical risk/reward means that you can only lose $4k but the upside is at least $1m.  pic.twitter.com/mzh4EzutV6
1097892658767372295 2019-02-19 11:16:22 EDT <APompliano> Estonia just ordered the Danske Bank branch to close that was involved in one of the largest money laundering schemes in history.

1097888800506855424 2019-02-19 11:01:02 EDT <HammerToe> Ripple as a whole (as a concept) is older than Bitcoin, yeah. But the XRP cryptocurrency itself was developed by Bitcoin developers who developed an innovate and more efficient means to solve the double spend problem.
1097888075651239936 2019-02-19 10:58:09 EDT <NickSzabo4> Definitions are not reality, they are just very lossy summaries. They are also not much help in discovering use cases.  If you want to understand Bitcoin, or understand  what it's useful for, headlines and tweet-sized definitions are certainly not going to do it for you.
1097887728694448129 2019-02-19 10:56:46 EDT <Josh_Rager> $BTC Chart  Bitcoin currently at resistance level with a break and close above $4100 is bullish  But...

1097880173469491207 2019-02-19 10:26:45 EDT <BobLoukas> To much focus on whether #bitcoin #crypto made bear markets lows.  Who cares, #HODLers are already long and blind, and traders should care only about swings/trend.  In front of us we have a great Swing higher, leave the bear market narrative aside for the time being.
1097879071093067777 2019-02-19 10:22:22 EDT <hasufl> It's generally tricky to be a bitcoin whatever-ist, because it ties your identity to bitcoin. As a result, attacks on bitcoin feel more personal and it gets harder to openly discuss flaws of the system (How many of us can accurately describe about our own flaws?)
1097877936881975296 2019-02-19 10:17:52 EDT <lvlewitinn> This is nuts: If you had listened to @aplusk when he tweeted this about @SenSanders and @realDonaldTrump , you would have bought #Bitcoin at $378 and realized close to 10x returns over three years. To paraphrase @APompliano, you'd be long Bitcoin, short the temper tantrums.  https://twitter.com/aplusk/status/692915871761702913¬†‚Ä¶

1097871752011702273 2019-02-19 09:53:17 EDT <DeribitExchange> For the first time in BTC existence, the worldwide 24h BTC options volume exceeded 9,000 BTC.   Deribit reached a new 24h BTC option volume record of 9,200 BTC.   More professional parties are seeking BTC Options to hedge their positions.  Bitcoin is undeniably growing.
1097871389162463234 2019-02-19 09:51:51 EDT <hasufl> I think Bitcoin maximalism is having a bit of an identity crisis. Five different people give you five different definitions. What's the point of using it anymore?

Maximally confident, minimally maximalist.

1095685069484814336 2019-02-13 09:04:12 EDT <hasufl> The takeaways: - future life expectancy of money and other Lindy goods goes up over time, not down - the USD might well have another 50-100 years ahead of it - new money competes on survival, not features - so appreciate Bitcoin's defensive developer attitude
1095685068473974784 2019-02-13 09:04:11 EDT <hasufl> All cryptos fight an uphill battle against established fiat currencies. And they compete less on features than you think and more on survival.  Most people will not start trusting Bitcoin's architecture. They trust their experience with it. And experience requires time.

If we're talking about a $10T vertical, that still would still leave $1-2T for altcoins.

1093954993562935296 2019-02-08 14:29:29 EDT <CryptoUB> (4/4) My point is, the sentiment feels very similar to around the Bitcoin top. Where people were calling for much higher.   Now people are calling for MUCH lower. Shorting bounces has made the most sense to me for months.   Longing pullbacks are going to start making sense soon.
1093954931592024064 2019-02-08 14:29:15 EDT <CryptoUB> (3/4) Based on the Bitcoin Monthly chart, I don't see how I can continue to short bounces for another 4 - 5 months.

1093483143728906240 2019-02-07 07:14:32 EDT <brucefenton> If you added inflation to Bitcoin it wouldn‚Äôt be Bitcoin anymore.  It would be a chain fork.   Unless a fork is not contentious, it results in a split.  Clearly inflation is contentious so the fork with inflation would be a new alt coin. And Bitcoin would keep on being Bitcoin.
