When a token moves to its own mainnet, its price is still dependent on Bitcoin price. Meaning, it doesn't get a USD trading pair just by going from an ERC-20 to its own standard. That would be up to the exchange

Now I am again saying that I see Bitcoin settling around $2000 to $3000 range. It may have a bounce, if it does, from here for the last time but eventually it will settle at 10% of its HIGHEST VALUE.

979227924896329728 2018-03-29 01:25:05 EDT <VinnyLingham> Ethereum‚Äôs recent fall is somewhat supporting BTC as a reliable crypto store of value, but when ETH bottoms, then there is less of a cushioning effect for Bitcoin  fiat liquidity demands will put extra pressure on BTC. We‚Äôre seeing some semblance of that right now in the market.
979227922878926848 2018-03-29 01:25:04 EDT <VinnyLingham> The emergence of a trustless StableCoin will put extra pressure on Bitcoin if exchanges start listing trading pairs against StableCoins, and then alts start trading primarily against USD and other major fiat currencies. Do not underestimate the amount of trading pair arbitrage.
979227920257470464 2018-03-29 01:25:04 EDT <VinnyLingham> In general, I think this is a healthy period of consolidation for crypto, and we‚Äôll be better for it. The question really is will it last a few month, or until next year. Biggest risks for breaking the Feb 6 support will be if Bitcoin decouples and then miner profitability.

Bitcoin may still soar after the switchover as people panic, after which it will decline as people realize the new money system is stable. Also fiat will be immediately replaced. #QAnon #EndTheFed https://twitter.com/5Strat/status/978433728992051200¬†‚Ä¶

975933519854690304 2018-03-19 23:14:17 EDT <justicemate> You've left no doubt in my mind that you are hostile towards Bitcoin.  Litecoin had a different PoW which ended up having ASICs built for it. Monero had a different PoW whihc ended up having ASICs built for it.  You are running away from innovation. ASICs save power.

975741736382279680 2018-03-19 10:32:13 EDT <RichardHeartWin> People ask what leverage to use. It's the wrong question. Trading 1% of stack at 10x leverage vs 10% of stack at 1x leverage... Position size matters more for risk, leverage for liquidation price. Use stops & leverage matters less. #Bitcoin #Ethereum #cryptocurrency
975741212991762432 2018-03-19 10:30:08 EDT <AnselLindner> #Bitcoin is a concept, like the wheel.  No one is in charge of defining a wheel, guiding uses or dictating new versions. The invention of the wheel spread quickly where ever introduced because it was useful.  Altcoins are trying to reinvent the wheel, instead of building with it.

975601012319883264 2018-03-19 01:13:01 EDT <pierre_rochard> There's a persistent myth that the NYA / s2x was not an attack on Bitcoin.

Investing is based on valuation, on estimating the present value of future cash flows, buying when price lags fundamentals. What you're doing - buying no matter the price, without understanding fundamentals - is drunken gambling.

I'm not bullish because I saw Bitcoin hit $20k  a few months ago.

975250472683552768 2018-03-18 02:00:06 EDT <JaPennz> Correct..nobody said LN was Bitcoin. Bitcoin is and does function as P2P as stated in the white paper you provided. LN is a second layer payment protocol. So what is your point other than pointing out negatives?

975249881852817408 2018-03-18 01:57:45 EDT <Bitcoin> Bitcoin worked just fine until it was made unreliable by network congestion and high fees.   After the August 1st fork, Bitcoin Cash continues to work as Bitcoin always did, while Bitcoin Core has set down an experimental path that is not even developed yet.
975249674486591489 2018-03-18 01:56:56 EDT <lucasmzanella> yes they can (please study the protocol more). A miner can censor and demand KYC for any transaction, but of course others won't and they're the ones who will process your transaction. Same goes for ln hubs. Anyone can be one, and create ita own rules (who tf would deman kyc lol)

975249146100695040 2018-03-18 01:54:50 EDT <Bitcoin> Miners cannot censor transactions or demand KYC to process Bitcoin transactions.   LN hubs can do both.
975248650413789185 2018-03-18 01:52:52 EDT <dAnconiaMining> Lightning network is already working on methods to split large payments into multiple smaller routes which end up at the same final destination.  One should be suspicious of anyone who spends all their time pointing out the flaws in another project rather than promoting theirs
975248587163500544 2018-03-18 01:52:37 EDT <Bitcoin> Posting a GIF image does not refute the argument being made. The LN cult is unable to debate with logic and rely on ad hominem and name calling. pic.twitter.com/2Z6JtFXY9u

975247096482742272 2018-03-18 01:46:41 EDT <Bitcoin> Lightning Network won't be able to route most payments without going through large, centralized, payment hubs.

974631994968674304 2018-03-16 09:02:30 EDT <wintercooled> Another benefit of #LightningNetwork is that transactions happening on LN are not affected if a large % of Bitcoin's hash rate switches to mine another SHA256 based coin (as during BCH's EDA fiasco). This mitigates risks of slow payment confirmations until difficulty retarget.

973797099337895943 2018-03-14 01:44:55 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> Bitcoin is a means to transfer money, nothing more.

And Karpeles is going to walk away from this with hundreds of millions of dollars of his clients' money. You couldn't make this up.

972291935208660993 2018-03-09 21:03:56 EDT <Yakherders> Whenever I see an alt go up by 1000% or more in a span of a few weeks or less (these are arbitrary numbers), chances are it will go right back down by anywhere from 50-80%, sometimes all the way back down. $6k in Bitcoin's case is 70%. That's probably the lowest we go.

972284366226325505 2018-03-09 20:33:51 EDT <LukeDashjr> @BitPay, if you want to add a 7.6% surcharge to people who pay with #Bitcoin, and make BCH payments surcharge-free, that's your right, but please don't lie about it being a "network cost".  The network cost/fee is paid 100% upfront by the user BEFORE you even see the transaction.

971869458309394433 2018-03-08 17:05:09 EDT <stephanlivera> Roger's vision seems to be that bitcoin should have done everything. But in practice, trying to to be all things to all people weakens you. Instead, bitcoin should be the BEST money, and nothing else. Other things can be built on top of the best money.  https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/971866684016549889¬†‚Ä¶
971868368146976771 2018-03-08 17:00:50 EDT <WhalePanda> MtGox was terrible and the incompetent way they are handling is terrible, saying that Bitcoin has been crashing since ATH because of it is just silly. It's "only" 40k $BTC. It is about the same as claiming that Tether caused the run to $20k. People love their narratives though.

971700037469208576 2018-03-08 05:51:56 EDT <Beautyon_> If you have a VC interest in Bitcoin, you have to fund Bitcoin businesses. There is no substitute for this, no short cuts, and nothing you do around the crusty, dirty edges is a substitute for it. Thankfully some people DO get it, and that is enough to change everything forever.
971699716168839169 2018-03-08 05:50:40 EDT <Beautyon_> "Engaging" is not innovation. Collaborating with other non builders to stifle innovation is not entrepreneurialism. Doing good is not innovation. Or what you _think_ is good. The arcs of the Bitcoin ecosystem circle are being built...and they are being funded. This is a FACT.

971584805908426752 2018-03-07 22:14:03 EDT <LoadTheDip> Taking the name Bitcoin for your own when you actually represent Bitcoin Cash is the issue here. It is identity theft no matter how much you claim you are the original Bitcoin. You do yourself a disservice by misrepresentation.

The leveraged fiat system is fragile.  All it takes is one major bank to go down and or get hacked and the entire system will crater in on itself.

971268131862835201 2018-03-07 01:15:42 EDT <AriDavidPaul> I'm fond of saying that in some ways, Monero is more Bitcoin than Bitcoin.  You know I'm a huge fan of the project.  But....fewer nodes, development is a pretty firm "push" from trusted devs, and likely more concentrated ownership.  (can only guess due to lack of 'rich list.')

971137699540332550 2018-03-06 16:37:25 EDT <RedPillTrading> Even if LN fails in one way or another (unlikely, IMHO), bitcoin remains unchanged and immutable. LN takes the right approach by building on top of the existing protocol to achieve scale.

970745144550084609 2018-03-05 14:37:32 EDT <remyers_> I have been thinking about @NickSzabo4's talk about social scalability and the social fog of modern life.  Could a WoT network of people we know IRL be used to route the fiat side of decentralized noncustodial fiat/bitcoin exchanges? You can trust a friend won't reverse paypal.

970741965384921088 2018-03-05 14:24:54 EDT <paulsnx2> People are upset that North Korea can mine Bitcoin, but miss the bigger picture:   Bitcoin forces NK to mine properly for their Bitcoin, without one single army, law, agreement, or treaty  Yet all the armies of the west can't seem to stop N.K. from counterfeiting $100 bills  Huh.

970737360764788736 2018-03-05 14:06:36 EDT <CremeDeLaCrypto> As a supra-sovereign asset, it makes sense that Bitcoin could be perceived as a hedge against war between nation states (trade war, currency war, or actual war)
970736614275153926 2018-03-05 14:03:38 EDT <CobraBitcoin> Increased my holdings of Bitcoin Cash today. There was a long need for a blockchain good for payments, that makes certain tradeoffs to achieve that, and I think from a UX point of view, Bitcoin Cash has much better chances of winning the upcoming payments war than LN.

970430152889876480 2018-03-04 17:45:52 EDT <scottbuszard> I argue that BTC is the entirely different way forward. BCH is more in line with the original direction that Bitcoin was on. There was never any talk of SegWit or LN until quite recently (2015-12-21 for BIP141, January 14, 2016 for LN WP). Limiting block size to 1mb led to HF.

970428721256542210 2018-03-04 17:40:11 EDT <eric_lombrozo> It's a lot more rewarding to prove skeptics wrong by making something actually work than it is to prove why someone's idea is terrible. In the early days of Bitcoin the focus was almost entirely on the former, but then irrational exuberance along with unscrupulous folks came in.

969285459951075329 2018-03-01 13:57:16 EDT <parabolictrav> 6/ In conclusion, I feel Bitcoin's price behaviour is extremely patternistic, and analyzing its historical price movements gives intel about what may happen in the near future.
969285458193629184 2018-03-01 13:57:16 EDT <parabolictrav> 5/ After past median line consolidations, it ascends to the top of the log channel at breakneck speed. Historically, each move off the median line takes it to the top within 2-3 months. This is why I feel being bearish whatsoever about Bitcoin may be very costly.  pic.twitter.com/BL6mqsTCqx
969285456683675648 2018-03-01 13:57:15 EDT <parabolictrav> 4/ From what I can tell, once Bitcoin moves off the bottom channel upwards, it hits the median line (dotted line) and consolidates (in yellow). You could probably find that the eco-system goes through some form of upgrade during these past consolidations.  pic.twitter.com/FC1Fxq4CgX
