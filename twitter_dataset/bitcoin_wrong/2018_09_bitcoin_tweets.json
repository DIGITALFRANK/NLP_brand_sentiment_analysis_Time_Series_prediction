Monero‚Äòs current range proof uses the same security assumptions than Bulletproofs (discrete log is hard) which in fact is a better assumption than the ECDSA assumption. So at least theoretically it has the same security.

Bitcoin was written to destroy Perspective and Nuance Doctrine, end the debate about money and nullify all arguments about it. Now you must conform to reality or starve.
1044886544597823488 2018-09-26 05:48:59 EDT <Beautyon_> This is hard for some people to believe, being trained that everything is a matter of perspective (Perspective and Nuance Doctrine) but there really are not "sides" in every subject; some things are absolutely true and other things are impossible. This is why Bitcoin was written.

Tx fees will need to be at least $16 x 2500tx per block.

1044444547760164865 2018-09-25 00:32:39 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> Like all scams, the Bitcoin Ponzi relied on the argument that ‚Äúit‚Äôs different this time, because of details that are too complex for you to understand‚Äù. Like in every single scam ever, rational critics were pushed aside and ridiculed by the proud bagholders of magic beans.
1044443211954040833 2018-09-25 00:27:21 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> The saddest part of the Bitcoin Ponzi is that like all scams, it fed on the weakest and least educated members of our society. They were easy to dupe into believing that ‚Äúyou can become rich by printing your own money‚Äù, as long as the lie was wrapped in pseudo economics bullshit.

1044212222170460161 2018-09-24 09:09:28 EDT <TheStalwart> Of course Bitcoin isn't going to be better for buying coffee or whatever. A better comparison is, if you're living in China, is it cheaper than going to macau, converting your RMB to casino chips. Playing baccarat. Cashing out. And then converting your chips to USD.
1044211809740353536 2018-09-24 09:07:50 EDT <TheStalwart> This article repeats a common fallacy, that Bitcoin is a failure because it's slower and more expensive than Visa. That's not the relevant comparison though. The question is whether it's slower/faster than other means of making censorship-free transactions  https://www.ft.com/content/1b722b1c-bd83-11e8-8dfd-2f1cbc7ee27c¬†‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/S3In4WXJvD

1044207826346889216 2018-09-24 08:52:00 EDT <BitcoinErrorLog> Here are some of the things I learned in this experience: - Core is decently decentralized - TBF was riddled with egomaniacs and lacked real talent - BTC orgs should not try to "represent" Bitcoin - Bitcoin still benefits from organized volunteer efforts, even if it's difficult.
1044207820290379779 2018-09-24 08:51:59 EDT <BitcoinErrorLog> Our efforts to create an organized Bitcoin Core PR had a little impact in that we were able to convince @coindesk to add Bitcoin core devs and topics to #Consensus2015 -- which ended up being important because it was when Craig & Gavin pulled their Satoshi scam. /6
1044207818461638656 2018-09-24 08:51:59 EDT <BitcoinErrorLog> The new BF mostly ignored my conceptual suggestions to stay away from trying to represent Bitcoin or help with lobbying, and to focus on supporting development and education and, even after redefining itself, it remained faded into obscurity under the new ED. /5

This is no official organisation, Bitcoin doesn't need it. But it can benefit from a focused energy. So, I'll do that, u can thank me later.

1043982424974209026 2018-09-23 17:56:21 EDT <Beautyon_> What people don't like is the feeling of not being in control of how additions to Bitcoin are made. That's just too bad. If you don't have the skill to develop, you're a CONSUMER of other people's services and are relegated to that status forever. Rather than fight it embrace it.
1043981905794928642 2018-09-23 17:54:17 EDT <Beautyon_> This "stop changing the code" is exactly like Roger Ver being against SegWit. He wanted the developers to stop changing the code and leave Bitcoin as he imagines his imaginary Satoshi would have left Bitcoin. No open source software project works like that, especially big ones.

1043148219285266432 2018-09-21 10:41:30 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> It‚Äôs a fact traditionally the majority of wealth tends to reside in the older generation. This means they prefer to hold in traditional assets. E.g. shares, bonds and precious metals. The younger generation already see #bitcoin as an important part of their portfolio.

1043142137506877441 2018-09-21 10:17:20 EDT <fluffypony> Why would anyone believe Monero is superior to Bitcoin? The logical next step is to conclude that Monero can / will succeed in the event that Bitcoin fails, and that‚Äôs clearly garbage. Bitcoin *must* succeed for Monero to even have a shot at being around for longer than 5 mins.

Step 3: Once you've made your contribution, retire from Bitcoin to maintain the leaderless ethos while forcing other Bitcoiners to step up and replace you.

1042909748717383681 2018-09-20 18:53:55 EDT <nic__carter> Fun fact: for the first year of Bitcoin's existence, inflation was "too slow."

Bitcoin's own testnet3 can't do it because testnet3 coins have no value, so no incentives for malicious actors to hack it. Litecoin helps Bitcoin. That is extremely valuable.

TRUTH: Even if Litecoin's only use case is a testnet, you can't put an absolute value on it. Need to look at it relative to Bitcoin. Litecoin's marketcap is only 3% of Bitcoin's marketcap. That is not very large at all!

1042341641347063808 2018-09-19 05:16:27 EDT <Beautyon_> Remember too that they would keep increasing the block size Because Roger demands it. That would mean the cost of running a full node would be greater than running a Bitcoin node, should anyone see any reason for doing that. They've totally, unambiguously lost every argument.
1042341196067164160 2018-09-19 05:14:41 EDT <Beautyon_> Even at this high level looking down it's clear that bCash would offer nothing over Bitcoin, and would in fact be a risky proposition as they are downstream from innovation. There would be no reason to run it over Bitcoin, and no one would run it. A total waste of time and money.

1042192910966562816 2018-09-18 19:25:27 EDT <APompliano> Lol what?!?  Gemini dollar has to KYC/AML everyone and can be frozen, along with reverse transactions.  Bitcoin is about avoidance of seizure & censorship, just as much as it is about escaping hyperinflation.

1041859423772307457 2018-09-17 21:20:18 EDT <pierre_rochard> Ersatz barter tokens are great for small-time crypto hedge funds with little capital and month-long time horizons, but they are too illiquid for serious portfolio managers interested in a long-term medium of exchange growth story. For some, even Bitcoin is not liquid enough yet..

1041833057752428544 2018-09-17 19:35:31 EDT <CobraBitcoin> The 10th anniversary of Bitcoin would be great time for the whitepaper to be updated and modernised, with terminology corrected, mistakes removed, and any incorrect notions or hints of miners 'voting' on changes erased. New users need an updated introduction to Bitcoin.

1041762549233016832 2018-09-17 14:55:21 EDT <TheCryptoDog> If you are long term bullish on #Bitcoin, the low $6000s is a good place to begin averaging in. We could see much lower prices, and that's not a bad thing. The bear market is a game of accumulation. Be patient with your capital and average in slowly. Trade the flips if you must.

1041703565801283584 2018-09-17 11:00:58 EDT <BashCo_> Bcash propagandists are pushing a narrative that Bitcoin becomes "unusable" under high volume. This is totally false. The reality is that on-chain transactions become more expensive when there is more demand for block space, pricing out some use cases. Bitcoin remains usable.

1041029116697485312 2018-09-15 14:20:57 EDT <Crypto_Skipper> Bitcoin, contrary to what many say, has intrinsic value, unlike the $USD. Its value comes from the fact that it is at the same time currency and payment system. The payment system is the source of value, while the accounting unit simply expresses that value in terms of price.

1039804962606391297 2018-09-12 05:16:36 EDT <udiWertheimer> Bitcoin has historically been very kind to #buidlers. Some built businesses that saw extreme growth. Others built things that didn‚Äôt enjoy (or aim at) commercial success - but staying focused helped hodling (due to better grip at fundamentals) and avoiding noise about speculation

I have tried to help other ideas besides Bitcoin get off the ground with sincere intention. After 7 years working on such ideas, I have yet to see anything close.

1038835329736892422 2018-09-09 13:03:37 EDT <Beautyon_> This is a very clear, and unambiguous warning to all developers of Bitcoin apps that are distributed via Google Play and Apple's App Store. Sadly, since this is a war situation, Gab should sue Google if they can to be reinstated and obtain damages.
1038835214448033792 2018-09-09 13:03:10 EDT <mbenchi10> 1/ A great report made by the Edelman Trust Barometer Global Report. Some reasons I believe #bitcoin will keep on the rise is because the global population is trusting less centralized entities (data doesn't lie), they need another solution. Bitcoin offers P2P trustless networks  pic.twitter.com/roUXVMtxJk
1038834321325543427 2018-09-09 12:59:37 EDT <Beautyon_> Right on cue, Gab's app is removed from the Google Play store for "Hate Speech". Gab is not responsible for the speech of it's users, any more than Twitter or Google Plus is. This is not about policy, rules or reason, it is an ideological war. This can happen to Bitcoin apps.  pic.twitter.com/tMk3Bbb9cG

Ridiculing and demonizing it because they know exactly that there's no place for them in that new system. No place for elitist middlemen fiddling around with monetary policy destroying lives
1038811798521229312 2018-09-09 11:30:07 EDT <simonlutz21> 1/ There's a lot of opinions about what we are fighting against with Bitcoin. Warren Buffet famously called Bitcoin "rat poison", so let's dissect the rat. Safe to say it's not retail banking, rather we are questioning the legitimacy of a far more powerful organisation, the BIS.  pic.twitter.com/F3YGNoa6Am

1038791049009930240 2018-09-09 10:07:40 EDT <coinjunky> The true way to bleed the greed out of the crypto market is if bitcoin retained its lows. If it falls with all the crap coins it's just rewarding people who made bad decisions and allowing them to buy cheap bitcoin.
1038788421278285830 2018-09-09 09:57:14 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> Very few companies are able to maintain trust long term. They all fall from grace eventually usually due to greed and corruption. #bitcoin doesn‚Äôt have this problem because it‚Äôs trustless. Greed and corruption is a purely human characteristic. BTC is not human.
1038787330268491776 2018-09-09 09:52:53 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> Big difference between #bitcoin and shares is share price is always affected by sentiment. BTC price is also affected by sentiment short term but long term it has little significance. The difference is shares are mostly just traded, BTC on the other hand is mostly being adopted.
1038787079382097922 2018-09-09 09:51:54 EDT <onemanatatime> If you just found out about crypto, perfect timing to buy the next generational bottom in Bitcoin.

Setting aside your feelings about Infowars, you'd have to be stupid not to see how dangerous this is for Bitcoin wallets. Apple can and has killed wallets without warning.

1037634915624464384 2018-09-06 05:33:36 EDT <Beautyon_> In the Bitcoin world, it will not be possible to make a bad argument and then have that argument turned into law that can hurt anyone. There will be no money to do it, and no one will go along with anything that isn't their business. All violent types will be tightly controlled.
1037634609859555330 2018-09-06 05:32:23 EDT <Beautyon_> This is a fallacious argument; the Straw Man. If you're going to excuse behaviour you've got to make a logical argument and not a fallacious one. On top of this in the case of SS, there is a clear history of anti-Bitcoinism and multicoinism.

1037181067201933313 2018-09-04 23:30:10 EDT <real_vijay> 3/ Bitcoin survived because of a strong streak of corporate suspicion in its community. That suspicion is now trained on ShapeShift, which is clearly changing the nature of its business at the expense of the privacy of its users.

That's the beauty of the digital world. We set its properties as we may. So instead of being a myth, Bitcoin is very real, and goes beyond physical limitations.

What's more likely is that some has created a "synthetic" call option for themselves. Essentially the opposite of what happened on okcasino.

1037057629661552640 2018-09-04 15:19:41 EDT <realpauleverton> People like to talk about Satoshi's 'pre-mine'. But they conveniently ignore the fact that Bitcoin was worth practically nothing. In the six months post-Satoshi mining $BTC was worth around $0.06-$0.07. So the whole Bitcoin 'pre-mine' was at most worth $70,000.

Also, BTC is not a store of value. No cryptocurrency is, yet. BCH has potential as the chain of Bitcoin with most utility. Utility creates demand and thus value.

1036295525761523712 2018-09-02 12:51:21 EDT <matt_odell> Bitcoin is more 'fair' than USD.  Bitcoin is more 'fair' than gold.  Bitcoin is more 'fair' than ethereum.  Bitcoin is more 'fair' than ripple.  Bitcoin is more 'fair' than the overwhelming majority of systems we rely on everyday.  Bitcoin is 'fair' money.
1036295523442024448 2018-09-02 12:51:20 EDT <matt_odell> Every bitcoin holder has contributed work for the bitcoin they own. They either used their fiat(from work) to buy bitcoin or their compute to mine bitcoin. It's a voluntary & permissionless system, there's nobody to blame except for yourself if you choose not to participate.
1036295522297044993 2018-09-02 12:51:20 EDT <matt_odell> There's never been a 'launch' as 'fair' as bitcoin's in the history of money.  Bitcoin won't solve existing inequality magically but it gives you the guarantee of a 'fair' money system. One that isn't easily corrupted by those with power. All participants are on equal footing.

Their endgame is power.
1036267683896074242 2018-09-02 11:00:43 EDT <ArminVanBitcoin> Dude, stop. #altcoins pump for two days and you're already calling it alt season? Altcoins are centralized copy cats of #bitcoin that have thus far proven to have zero utility. Don't lure people into this shit. It's going to backfire on you. People won't easily forget.

Bitcoin Cash is bigger than you. Change when absolutely necessary is how Bitcoin works, and why BCH exists.  Not because you like change.
