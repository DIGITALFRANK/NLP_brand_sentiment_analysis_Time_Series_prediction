1134189530360307714 2019-05-30 16:07:10 EDT <BHoarder1> Dr. Wright previously discussed objective measure to determine fair Bitcoin price. At 128 MB blocks, each is worth $515 fair market value. At 2 GB blocks capacity (coming July 2019), $7,800.  1 MB blocks (i.e. BTC), $5. So #BSV still undervalued and for the upgrade massively so.

1134185854765682688 2019-05-30 15:52:34 EDT <jgettbtc> When someone dislikes #bitcoin they loudly complain and criticize. But when someone gets it and starts to accumulate they tend to be quiet about it (esp. if they formally disliked it). So it will always seem like the whole world is against #bitcoin until suddenly it isn't.

So #Bitcoin decided to hit his entry price, and his take losses price in 16 min.

Almost no Bitcoin activity.  Part of the reason is of course the price -- it's expensive to do silly things with Bitcoin, which makes bitcoiners more virtuous.

1133925455025721344 2019-05-29 22:37:50 EDT <Excellion> 9/ I can see how it's easy for Matt to lash out in anger & blame me for "the worst parts of Bitcoin culture.” Ironically, that’s analogous to what many Bitcoin company CEO’s did when blaming Core devs for not increasing block size. It’s an oversimplification to get a mob going.

1133816980874694657 2019-05-29 15:26:48 EDT <jfnewbery> But on top of all of that, Matt's done more than almost anyone to build a welcoming Bitcoin developer community and help people get into Bitcoin protocol development.

1133760182658277377 2019-05-29 11:41:06 EDT <alexbosworth> As long as someone has a similar conception of Bitcoin to me and is in any way supporting its success I have a hard time bearing any hard feelings towards them. There is a natural fellowship of mission that has the power to keep a lot of prickly individuals in the same direction.

1133366961046458370 2019-05-28 09:38:35 EDT <saifedean> Bitcoin's poetic justice: the more a person suffers from easy money, the easier it is to understand bitcoin, and the earlier they join it.

1133159595642380288 2019-05-27 19:54:35 EDT <BitcoinErrorLog> Not the most convincing argument against it. Why do you think replacement is likely? What evidence or relevance does manipulation have on BTC persistence? Have you done the math on what size the market would be if 1-5% of all investment-ready wealth was stored in Bitcoin?

I’ll still wait. A lot alts will be cheap as chips if Bitcoin can do another leg up 🤗
1133104256108716033 2019-05-27 16:14:41 EDT <XrpMr> Perspective  11/25/17 Bitcoin was $8789  11/25/17 XRP was .25  We are way ahead of the game compared to last time.  🕶️

1133102816925560832 2019-05-27 16:08:58 EDT <DominanceXrp> How can anybody debate that #Bitcoin is more decentralised than $XRP  No central unit can shot down the XRPL  The Government of China could destroy #Bitcoin if they wanted to with a 51% attack. This will happen if BTC becomes too powerful and means of escaping capital from China

1133100873586864128 2019-05-27 16:01:14 EDT <Excellion> The principles of self-sovereignty, which draw many to #Bitcoin, don’t mix well with efforts to police thoughts and behaviors.

1133100181157830658 2019-05-27 15:58:29 EDT <YORK780> If Bitcoin breaks trough $10000 we will likely make a new ATH.   Meanwhile we are still in 4 digit land. The big accumulate zone.

1133095078954786817 2019-05-27 15:38:13 EDT <AdamPaulMoore> Why are Bitcoin Maximalists so “toxic”? Because they are *owners*.   What do I mean?  They are not mere investors who are looking to make a quick buck.   They are invested in the long term growth, success, and adoption of BTC.   This is not a game or hobby or club. This is war.

1132960619227996160 2019-05-27 06:43:55 EDT <CryptoCred> $BTC looks strong.  When Bitcoin is making rapid gains, it becomes harder to outperform it (margin trading, altcoins, et cetera).  One of the best plays from the bottom was to do nothing at all.  Too much bear market PTSD — it’s okay to just watch your spot $BTC go up in value.

Is $BTC poised to touch five figures again this week? https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/05/27/bitcoin-surges-to-highest-price-for-over-a-year-will-it-reach-10k-this-week/ …

Preferably a retest of the old resistance block for S/R flip is what to look for here.   If we can't hold the $8,400 area -> back in range.  If we can -> rally towards $9,000+.  pic.twitter.com/HLSJ8IuFLu

That lights me up.

It is scrubbing away all the lies we tell each other and to ourselves. Most will go insane as a result. Some will be exalted. All will be extinct before the last block is hashed.

1132703287826878464 2019-05-26 13:41:23 EDT <cyounessi1> Huge shoutout to the Bitcoin Maximalists for their amazing job running the Ethereum Dev Referral program. Please keep up the hard work and continue sending devs our way 🙏
1132701289664720903 2019-05-26 13:33:26 EDT <maxkeiser> What I love most about #Bitcoin is that it will still be going strong after we’re extinct (circa 2060). BTC is our legacy, it’s what we’ll be remembered for in the cosmic multiverse, (and chocolate éclairs, of course).
1132699058999635971 2019-05-26 13:24:34 EDT <argumentwinner> youre a podcaster who made it big, choose your fate:  - bitcoin - buy and immediately total a mercedes - advise on the mike gravel campaign to try and recapture your youth - start an anarcho syndicalist compound on the michigan peninsula - buy a shitload of mids - become a dj
1132697803841400832 2019-05-26 13:19:35 EDT <SarahJamieLewis> Skepticism, cynicism, rigorous review and forthright language do exist  in some Bitcoin subcultures, others run on idolatry & quacksalvery and those subcultures are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

1132685113391628288 2019-05-26 12:29:09 EDT <timevalueofbtc> A true bitcoiner is pretty much always thinking about bitcoin. That’s why we’re always on twitter. Not to consume social media, but to participate in bitcoin’s open social nature. And learn. And discuss. Bitcoin is incredibly addictive like that.

1132683472068403200 2019-05-26 12:22:38 EDT <nvk> Adversarial environments are not for everyone. Not everyone is built to do everything.   People should strive for civility, but bitcoin also doesn’t care about that. A amoral money not bound to niceties is harder to be captured.  Encourage compassion, but don’t expect compassion.
1132682944139735040 2019-05-26 12:20:32 EDT <ToneVays> Why do 'intellectually challenged' people continue to compare $XRP to $BTC. #Ripple is NOT even a #Blockchain, NOT Decentralized or Trustless, etc. U should compare to @PayPal, NOT #Bitcoin.

1132676378099249153 2019-05-26 11:54:27 EDT <ErikVoorhees> Fiat is this context literally means, "by decree."  Fiat currency is value "by decree" meaning because a government declared it as such.  Gold and bitcoin are thus not fiat, as no decree establishes their value.

It will be lower than central banks 2% inflation rate and even with gold's supply rate yearly increase.  This is one of the most important events in the history of money.

But the witch hunt tendencies point an ugly finger back to own FEARS.  Relax, Bitcoin can be attacked but can’t be turned off. We’re all fine.

1132508411390615552 2019-05-26 00:47:00 EDT <oleganza> Bitcoin is simultaneously the most direct attack on the state (it's the only thing that will necessarily shrink the empires), and also the most indirect: it's a gigantic workaround for the civilized society to slowly exit the entire pyramid of coercion without a single gun fire.

1132506536599728128 2019-05-26 00:39:33 EDT <oleganza> This is changing rapidly with crypto assets and Bitcoin in particular: finally, no matter how small capital you have, you have asymmetrically better security to preserve it. And no matter how big capital you have, extracting from others is disproportionately expensive.

It is easily and provably false; and that a network of over a hundred thousand computers worldwide verify the math.

1132395415578583041 2019-05-25 17:18:00 EDT <Rhythmtrader> People work 40 hours a week, sacrificing time with friends and family, for their weekly $905 paycheck (on average).

1132392372296228864 2019-05-25 17:05:55 EDT <CryptoBrekkie> Bitcoin is permissionless in many ways.  For instance, I don’t need anyone’s permission to be whatever kind of Bitcoiner I decide to be.   Neither do you.  Want to be closed minded, rude, & impatient? Go for it.  Want to be kind, understanding, & patient?   ..Even better. ✌🏻❤️🚀

1132219500953255936 2019-05-25 05:38:59 EDT <phyrooo> Satoshi did not invent the 'blockchain'. The idea of chained blocks existed way before Bitcoin for example in Git Source Control. Programmers just call their blocks a 'commit'. The key idea that was invented with Bitcoin is the Nakamoto Consensus.
1132216498821447680 2019-05-25 05:27:03 EDT <Juuso_I> Central banks are the first to be disrupted by the #Bitcoin revolution. They compete against Bitcoin's supply mechanism (Layer1).  Banks, payment processors and other fin services might be able to transform and live through (2nd layer disruption), but must become Bitcoin native.

1132185073757937664 2019-05-25 03:22:11 EDT <eric_lombrozo> Network protocols still couldn't care less. If Bitcoin is to become a global currency, a homogenous "Bitcoin culture" will make as much sense as a homogenous "Internet culture" - there will be many different cultures.
1132183901198270464 2019-05-25 03:17:31 EDT <eric_lombrozo> The reason I downplay the horrors of Bitcoin culture is not because they do not exist but because Bitcoin lacks any sort of culture enforcement regime. The individual must learn how to be sovereign, and this means being able to endure whatever the conditions may be.

1131246494663815168 2019-05-22 13:12:36 EDT <binarybits> The other plausible case for bitcoin's long-term value is as digital gold—a way to store wealth in a form that's easy to conceal/move and hard to expropriate. But if that's going to be Bitcoin's main long-term application then a lot of the surrounding activity is a waste of time.

1131098236331143169 2019-05-22 03:23:28 EDT <Beautyon_> People who think pricing in sats is a problem don't remember the Italian Lira; the market can easily adjust to these numbers and as the Bitcoin price goes up, nominal prices in sats go down. BTC at $100,000 makes sat prices smaller numbers. Pricing in sats is future proofing.  https://twitter.com/shaine_kennedy/status/1131064142427594752 …

It's going to be some mind-bending economic paradigm shift years from now that few will recognize early on. Investors that missed the "first Bitcoin" are going to miss the next one too.

It'll take some time, it's not going to happen in 2019.
1131013416695394304 2019-05-21 21:46:26 EDT <MiguelCuneta> 11/ To say that Bitcoin is not the right tech because it is too expensive to use is no different from saying that public internet infrastructure is not the right tech because internet connections and computers were too expensive in 1995. Again, internet cafe analogy stands.
1131013178098376710 2019-05-21 21:45:29 EDT <libertarianbit> So when Bitcoin used to be fast, cheap and reliable, it wasn't sound money at that time?

1130940890476769281 2019-05-21 16:58:14 EDT <el33th4xor> Here's a simple idea to improve the space.   Problem: there are many forks of Bitcoin. The reported marketcap is almost certainly misleading. For instance, if you fork BTC now, its marketcap is calculated by 21m*price, even though you'd probably have 0 interest in the coin.
1130939521036636160 2019-05-21 16:52:48 EDT <Bitcoin_Beyond> The BCH/BSV fork was about one side massively scaling Bitcoin and another side implementing a forced ordering on miners that has yet to show real results and adding an opcode that later added an unintended bug.  It was also about Craig Wright.  I wonder who has the last laugh?
1130938639666384897 2019-05-21 16:49:18 EDT <justicemate> Now if you purchased BSV on the news, I suggest you start reading CSWs medium posts and inventions over at nchain to realise the power of Bitcoin.  Avoid channels that intentionally smeared and worked hard to prevent you from opening your eyes.

1130813746262237184 2019-05-21 08:33:01 EDT <maxkeiser> Unlike Gold, #Bitcoin pays a dividend (mining rewards).   It has all the features of Gold, plus a hefty dividend paid every 10 minutes.   It has the features of a bond maturing in 2140, paying interest every 10 minutes, but it’s immutable and Hard Money like Gold.

Eventually you will and by then it’ll probably be much more expensive. Sometimes the price of learning can be very expensive. We all go through this in some shape or form.

1130565870026203140 2019-05-20 16:08:02 EDT <Dave_Jonez_02> Consider for a moment how undervalued $XRP is relative to current circumstances.

1130547923211739138 2019-05-20 14:56:44 EDT <jchervinsky> As expected, the SEC has delayed the VanEck bitcoin ETF proposal. Read the order here:  https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboebzx/2019/34-85896.pdf ….  VanEck's new deadline is August 19.

Governments will get more powerful, and use the losses to increase regulation on legitimate alternatives to fiat currency.

1130238957340561408 2019-05-19 18:29:00 EDT <APompliano> Bitcoin is a non-correlated, asymmetric return asset. By putting it in your portfolio, you can reduce the risk profile, increase sharpe ratio, and produce a material amount of impact on overall portfolio with a single digit allocation.  Essentially, it improves your portfolio :)
1130237984588980224 2019-05-19 18:25:08 EDT <GeorgeBLE17> Ok I tried this out, and it's absolutely stupid easy to use.

1130237782113308673 2019-05-19 18:24:20 EDT <fikretharmanli> Reminder that the SEC has deadlines this Thursday & next Tuesday to approve, deny, or delay its decisions on the Bitwise & VanEck bitcoin ETF proposals. My best guess at the probabilities:  - Delay, 90% - Denial, 1% - Approval, 9%  Delay means new deadlines on August 14 & 19.

1130230379212922880 2019-05-19 17:54:55 EDT <cash_en> Is it just my impression or is it evident for everyone that the number of BSV followers is very rapidly increasing by the day?

1130208227436695552 2019-05-19 16:26:54 EDT <notgrubles> At this point, nearly every person who has said Bitcoin will fail, for whatever reason, has gone and launched their own altcoin. It's like a prerequisite for trying to justify the obviously greedy premines and founder's taxes.

Don’t let the fatigue get to you.  Remember why we’re here. Remember what excites you about #Bitcoin and share that.  Everyone starts off as a noob.

If you believe in a protocol, you just buy its native token which effectively indexes its entire ecosystem. For instance, the ultimate Bitcoin bet is bitcoin. It's that simple.

1130135396141023232 2019-05-19 11:37:29 EDT <csuwildcat> An interesting byproduct of a lasting non-monetary use of Bitcoin is that it may establish a roughly calculable price floor for Bitcoin's intrinsic utility. This could result in positive side effects for monetary use and silence a common argument of critics (e.g. Schiff, Roubini)

1129899906565468160 2019-05-18 20:01:44 EDT <bsmith12251960> Signing with that key and sending that message was an EPIC BLUNDER for the anti-Craig crowd.  It will tie them to the very nefarious and illegal activities they are trying to pin on Satoshi... the very activities BSV and original Bitcoin were made to STOP, not enable.
1129896436718592001 2019-05-18 19:47:57 EDT <Rhythmtrader> Bitcoin breaking $8,000 is leading news now on most media outlets.

1129872652858904576 2019-05-18 18:13:27 EDT <_ConnerBrown_> Only after spending hours of my free time delving deep into Bitcoin (a luxury many won't have) did I start to realize the bcash narrative was fraudulent.   @StopAndDecrypt 's work was invaluable to me, along with @stephanlivera , @pierre_rochard and @bitstein's podcasts.
1129872652280029184 2019-05-18 18:13:26 EDT <_ConnerBrown_> After a few weeks, I signed up for @coinbase and saw bitcoin cash. I figured that if even Coinbase (a company I thought was legitimate at the time) was supporting BCH then it surely had some merit.   Roger had tricked me. I ended up buying some BCH on Coinbase.
1129869417175834625 2019-05-18 18:00:35 EDT <medialab> Tomorrow night, @60Minutes interviews a range of cryptocurrency users and experts, from the man who famously made the first real-world Bitcoin transaction (10,000 BTC for pizza) to @mitDCI head @neha. http://mitsha.re/3JTI30oLaSE 
1129869303606591491 2019-05-18 18:00:08 EDT <Rhythmtrader> 60% of all bitcoins have not moved in one year.  That's 10.5 million bitcoin being held as a store of value for the last 12 months.  This is a game of musical chairs. The music has stopped and these investors already found a chair to sit on.   Have you?
1129867148917035008 2019-05-18 17:51:34 EDT <callmethebear> I just had a discussion with a friends mother and we were talking about Bitcoin and she said hey Bitcoins back up to $300 and I was like no it’s at $7,000. She said she checked her @coinbase account that mng and I had to tell her she bought the wrong Bitcoin.
1129866800991227910 2019-05-18 17:50:11 EDT <fartface2000> Bitcoin is making me a better person, I went to Costco to buy a lounge chair and at the checkout the cashier asked me if I wanted to donate any money to  a child charity, so I said sure $20, she couldn’t believe it, I said “Don’t over react all fiat currency is going to 0”

1129817000295854081 2019-05-18 14:32:18 EDT <eric_lombrozo> To this day Bitcoin protocol developers continue to be subjected to libel and slander. These people are engineers, not politicians. VCs and CEOs who pushed the "fire the Core devs" narrative are directly complicit in this. Contrition would do much to heal wounds.
1129816485638148098 2019-05-18 14:30:15 EDT <giacomozucco> Stop lying and misleading newcomers, Peter. There absolutely isn't "more than one Bitcoin". There are many altcoins, some of them (I thing around 20/30) have "Bitcoin" in their name, only a couple of which with the clear purpose of committing commercial fraud against noobs.

1129743708830732289 2019-05-18 09:41:04 EDT <shesek> But, on the plus side, it created a strong precedent that bitcoin cannot and will not be controlled by corporate interests, even when in bed with >80% of hashing power and some of the largest exchanges and payment processors . So thanks for that.

1129723251565957124 2019-05-18 08:19:47 EDT <pierre_rochard> What makes Bitcoin hard to change is the p2p network of nodes.  Node operators choose which software they run based on the actual merits of the software, not based on political threats of hashrate withholding.  Bitcoin’s game theory simply does not support the latter, as we saw.

This was a battle of power & control over bitcoin.  Conservatism vs move fast & break things.  BCH has 32 MB blocks, wants g-blocks

1129302455739531266 2019-05-17 04:27:41 EDT <woonomic> Interestingly when Bitcoin Cash floated, it exhibited the same 3 cats fractal that Bitcoin had in early years. That told me it was the same psychology trading that coin in the early months. The early BTC traders were playing in that market.

1129299073054519298 2019-05-17 04:14:15 EDT <TheBitfi> Bitcoin mixing services aren’t foolproof. Transactions can still be traced by blockchain analytics. Better not to use them as it gives false confidence while analytics firms get even better data. They find more “interesting” transactions when users believe they are 100% private.  pic.twitter.com/MALbJBIEcl
1129298516734619649 2019-05-17 04:12:02 EDT <lawmaster> I find it very hard to believe that the SEC will approve a Bitcoin ETF any time soon given that their primary worry has always been manipulation of prices and Bitcoin's price was just brought down by a handful of actors by 20% in a matter of minutes.

Dips should be seen as good buying opportunities, unless we drop below the $6200 support level. Watch out for network congestion and fees hurting this run in the mid term if it moves up too quickly to test $20k.

They will become the JP Morgans of the 21st century.
1128893155720347649 2019-05-16 01:21:16 EDT <real_vijay> 9/ Another player that is pursuing a vertical strategy is @AbraGlobal. They allow their users to get exposure to US stocks (via derivatives) by posting #Bitcoin as collateral. This opens up US stock market returns to the whole world, build atop Bitcoin as a monetary base.

1128873523684896768 2019-05-16 00:03:16 EDT <wiz> Surprising thing I noticed about some Bitcoiners in USA is that despite owning and using Bitcoin, they mostly still really seem to want fiat in their bank account, and pay capital gains taxes on it too. They see Bitcoin as a way to get more fiat and not as a replacement for fiat.

1128869909151277057 2019-05-15 23:48:54 EDT <crypto_playboyx> According to  http://bitcoinfees.info  a bitcoin transaction fee costs about $4.12 right now to get into the next block (10min) and $3.26 for the next 6 blocks (1hr). $Nano still has 0 fees and you save about 9 minutes and 55-59 seconds.

If that means a #2 coin that's always changing every year then so be it, I don't really care TBH.  I'm not against alternatives existing, I'm just extremely doubtful any will ever compete with Bitcoin on these fronts.
1128845168151392256 2019-05-15 22:10:35 EDT <StopAndDecrypt> Are there going to be billions of people who can't use Bitcoin directly?  Yeah, of course.  But Bitcoin, in its current conservative form, is legitimately the most effective protest against all of the worlds establishment's main source of power: the creation & control of money.
1128844659982254080 2019-05-15 22:08:34 EDT <CryptoJokerLTC> I did it!!!!  I finally got my dad to take a small % of his 401K and buy #Bitcoin   I’m so happy!!  My dad busts my chops about buying near top on #LTC   But I find out he has been bragging to friends and fam saying...  “My boy was right. We should have bought at 3K”

1128843469009694720 2019-05-15 22:03:50 EDT <francispouliot_> The #1 use-case of Bitcoin: extend your life expectancy (survival).  The #2 use-case of Bitcoin: optimize your time on earth (fulfilment).  One need not look further.

1128835985989672961 2019-05-15 21:34:06 EDT <HenryTheETH> Bitcoin keeps climbing, defying efforts of those wishing to take profit and buy back lower. It is in these stages of the market cycle that we should never forget that in 1998, the Undertaker threw Mankind off the Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 feet thru the announcer’s table
1128835207627497472 2019-05-15 21:31:00 EDT <jonathanwilson> Gold is a hedge against network collapse. Bitcoin is a hedge against fiat collapse. USD is a hedge against progress.

1128755151060328448 2019-05-15 16:12:53 EDT <BobMcElrath> The Schnorr signature algorithm was developed by cryptographers who work on Bitcoin, not BCH, and copy pasted into BCH.   Copy paste is an inappropriate dev mechanism for any coin. If you don't have competent devs you'll create security vulnerabilities and hard forks.  https://twitter.com/checksum0/status/1128635995908399104 …

1128662041009565696 2019-05-15 10:02:54 EDT <MihailoBjelic> Misleading statements by @Melt_Dem on TV, not a good look.  Msft didn't move its ID project to Bitcoin, it's blockchain-agnostic. Msft is heavily involved *only* with Ethereum, as well as all big players from JPM to EY.

It is from block reorgs, stochastic OR coordinated, that bitcoin derives ALL of its decentralization properties. Without block reorgs we’d have a centralized protocol.

1128172174131507200 2019-05-14 01:36:21 EDT <ArminVanBitcoin> Alt season will start after most of #altcoin investors have sold and declared alts as dead. It will then end prematurely on a lower high BTC ratio once every idiot is back on board the #shitcoin wagon.  Hint: Don't get greedy. Buy #bitcoin, stay humble and be patient. 🍻

1128072392012644353 2019-05-13 18:59:51 EDT <VinnyLingham> Other than that, it's entirely likely that we are at the start of a recovery and then on to test new Bitcoin highs. It might take a year or so, but we're going to test $20k again at some point in the near future.
1128072389504512000 2019-05-13 18:59:50 EDT <VinnyLingham> What part of - "I'm bullish on Bitcoin if it breaks and holds $6200 for 24-48 hours" is ambiguous? Yes, I'm now bullish on Bitcoin. Do I think we hit $20k in the next month? Absolutely not, but, anything is possible...

Oh well. His misunderstandings, scams, and attacks ultimately made Bitcoin stronger.
1127725136021340161 2019-05-12 19:59:59 EDT <XRP_Anderson> David Schwartz is the true genius of this space. A lot of other leaders of projects just ride on the Bitcoin name.   Why Bitcoin? Because it has the biggest name recognition, not because of tech. It’s too hard to create a new blockchain, so they just do a hard fork of dated tech.
1127724908417470464 2019-05-12 19:59:04 EDT <ObiWanKenoBit> Bitcoin is like early electricity. Raw, dangerous, seems very volatile and hard to use. With time though it'll start to feel safer, easier and normal. Like electricity it will inspire and power new unimaginable industries. And one day we’ll wonder where did Bitcoin come from?

1127573231676866560 2019-05-12 09:56:22 EDT <davidgerard> Bitcoin just went from $5,656 to $7,581 in four days - a rise of nearly two thousand dollars. This time around, there's near-zero mainstream media interest. I've had no calls or emails asking why - though lots for the $400 bobbles through the past year. Not sure why.

1127489780646907904 2019-05-12 04:24:46 EDT <Coin_Shark> For people who hold a lotta $ALTS like me; this is nice. ✔️  Trust me, you want your alt positions to pump with a high(er) $BTC price.  Easier to take $FIAT profit (if needed) and stack $BTC for when (the possible upcoming) altszn comes to an end and Bitcoin continues to $1MM.
1127489650543644672 2019-05-12 04:24:15 EDT <WilmWiley> Craig Wright and the reverse ICO scam. Instead of taking your money to develop his project he gives you money to develop your project on bitcoin!  😡
1127489625906225153 2019-05-12 04:24:09 EDT <LarssonFuture> Binance’s week started 40 M down and ended with Bitcoin back in black, and alt season starting -> 2019 revenue forecast can comfortably be adjusted 400 M up.  Winning is not about not falling, it’s about getting back up. Go @binance @cz_binance $bnb!

Skin in the game in the bull/bear cycles of #Bitcoin.  Or walking in a crowded street.  Meditation isn’t to be scheduled.  It’s simply constant awareness.

1127383069546172416 2019-05-11 21:20:44 EDT <francispouliot_> Bitcoin markets are constantly attempting to identify the price floor which consists of hodlers of last resort refusing to sell. Simply put: the total bitcoins removed from liquid tradeable supply. Each rally, new hodlers are born at the expense of weak hands exiting.

1127231573567451136 2019-05-11 11:18:44 EDT <ercwl> So, Bitfinex premiums triggered a price increase again. Then a short squeeze took us to ~$7,000.  Soon, MSM will say bitcoin is back. Retail will buy back in and then it will correct. Retails will feel stupid for paying "$7,000" unit prices and start buying $0.1 shitcoins again.

Here are four examples that show BTC is no longer swayed by every bit of news that emerges in the market. https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-more-mature-asset-now-2017/ …
1127223987619155968 2019-05-11 10:48:36 EDT <CryptoCred> (2/2)  One of the drawbacks of my strategy is that I don’t buy breakouts.   So if the market breaches a high and simply keeps going (as $BTC has) I don’t get a setup.   That’s fine — I am happy to watch my spot Bitcoin go up in value and wait for A+ leveraged opportunities.

1127220150988693504 2019-05-11 10:33:21 EDT <CryptoDonAlt> To all the people trying to snipe the Bitcoin top by shorting it:  Have you thought about longing altcoins instead? They've been / are capitulating and will very likely explode the moment BTC tops out.  There is more money in that than shorting BTC in my opinion.
1127218097159659523 2019-05-11 10:25:11 EDT <davidjnixon> But Rep. Sherman confuses the the threat / outcome with the real purpose of #bitcoin, which, as @saifedean has so clearly elucidated, to provide sound money. Don’t blame crypto for the government’s failing.

1127215874841071616 2019-05-11 10:16:21 EDT <bitindo_io> Today 1 Satoshi = $0.00007 so micropayments are possible.   However, if the entire global money supply moved to #bitcoin by 2140 then 1 Satoshi will be $168. So $BTC doesn’t work as a currency. @apompliano @fundstrat @aantonop — am I getting this right?

A node becomes relevant when it's used to decide whether to accept or reject a payment.

1126898534211407872 2019-05-10 13:15:21 EDT <BTC_Macro> If your goal is simply to make money (or gain more $BTC), you shouldn't be in Bitcoin. You should buy alts.  Altcoins will pump MUCH more than $BTC. This has always been the case, and will most likely continue.  In the end, you gain more $USD or $BTC, and that's the goal. Right?

1126633371268829184 2019-05-09 19:41:42 EDT <eric_lombrozo> I worked with Bitcoin Core folks for years, up until and through the fork wars. Throughout that whole time, practically all the greatest contributions to Bitcoin came from people who had never even heard of Craig Wright until late 2015.

1126600268223848449 2019-05-09 17:30:09 EDT <MishaGuttentag> We've been told that bitcoin is a fraud, a ponzi, etc., and should be banned to protect consumers. But this is a strikingly different tone: Rep. Sherman says bitcoin should be banned to protect *the US Dollar*. That seems big.
1126600264100671488 2019-05-09 17:30:08 EDT <iamjosephyoung> I don't think the argument that crypto (like bitcoin) affects the power of USD as the standard unit in the global financial system is sound as of now.

1126464641922752512 2019-05-09 08:31:13 EDT <saifedean> This entire discussion ignores the most important lesson we learned from the S2X debacle. Miners are bitcoin's slaves, not masters. If you want to reverse a hack, your best bet is to get nodes to fork away from it. Anything else is pointless because it can be rejected by nodes.

1126462960996638723 2019-05-09 08:24:33 EDT <JamesTodaroMD> What if Bitcoin’s drop from $6k to $3k was bc of insider trading on the Bitfinex situation.  The community shrugged it off & we’re back at $6k.  Now imagine the Bitfinex situation never happened & price had been ~$6k since Nov.  It would prob feel like we are due for a bull mkt.
1126462860056571904 2019-05-09 08:24:09 EDT <AltcoinSara> Bitcoin at $3.2k: media slams crypto, calls it a bubble and predicts when it’ll go to zero.   Bitcoin at $6k with bullish momentum: media silent.
1126461432286126080 2019-05-09 08:18:28 EDT <morcosa> Important point. Debating these ideas and the game theory of Bitcoin is valuable. But considering acting on it in the moment is incredibly rash. $40 million is a lot, but not nearly enough to attempt a highly questionable intentional 51% attack.

1126278889049939969 2019-05-08 20:13:07 EDT <udiWertheimer> Important point. The point of the various bitcoin subsystems and incentives is to automate coordination.

1126261954362990597 2019-05-08 19:05:49 EDT <cyounessi1> Seeing some of the arguments surrounding the potential BTC re-org has me realize that people, *unironically*, truly think everything is good for bitcoin.

1126261198658449408 2019-05-08 19:02:49 EDT <LucasNuzzi> Very few things can create as much misinformation as a ~bitCoin bLocKchain reorg~  Goes to show how little people understand about the intricacies of Proof-of-Work <- this alone is a good enough reason not to pursue bailout reorgs.

1126230119868174336 2019-05-08 16:59:19 EDT <francispouliot_> This is such a stupid take. The exact opposite was demonstrated today. After such a long time studying Bitcoin one can only conclude either you are not intelligent enough or you have some sort of agenda (my guess is upping your profile to get some kind of consultation income).

1126225172665520128 2019-05-08 16:39:40 EDT <LandM_Marius> They call Bitcoin a fraud because of two reasons: 1. It’s in a bear market & there’s no turning back 2. They want to stop people from becoming financially independent   It’s convenient Binance got hacked just after the “Buffetts” of this world lashed out calling BTC a fraud.
1126224695890718724 2019-05-08 16:37:46 EDT <EmilyStewartM> One time these bitcoin guys told me about writing down their keys and hiding them in their yards with maps and maybe it wasn't such a bad idea after all.  https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/8/18537073/binance-hack-bitcoin-stolen-blockchain-security-safu …

1126224049145671681 2019-05-08 16:35:12 EDT <LandM_Marius> Warren Buffett calls ppl who invest in Bitcoin “dumb”. Now they resort to name calling us. So, let me get this clear Warren; “If I don’t invest in cryptos and move all my money over to the DOW does that make me smart?” The DOW is up 16%, Bitcoin +84% Who is smarter🤩  pic.twitter.com/CigvxmQZfh

1126222211574984704 2019-05-08 16:27:54 EDT <LandM_Marius> There’s so much talk that Bitcoin is a fraud, it’s going to die and the worlds going to end in pain. It’s simply not true. Bitcoin is doing great, ALT coins will all go to new all time highs. Ppl will become wealthy and debt free. And these thugs who call BTC a fraud know this 🤩

(Note: this is a question of how you think things ought to be, not about what's possible or practical)

1126196997692768259 2019-05-08 14:47:42 EDT <matt_odell> A technical focused person looking at stellar and bitcoin may come to the conclusion that transaction reversals are technically impossible on stellar but possible on bitcoin.  In reality, bitcoin tx reversals are extremely difficult while it only takes a court order on stellar.
1126196996644245504 2019-05-08 14:47:42 EDT <matt_odell> If you only look at the technical side and ignore the social game theory aspects you'll never understand how bitcoin works.  The loose game theory is what holds all this shit together.  Every actor is expected to act rationally in their own interests: greed and profit.

1126164111971246080 2019-05-08 12:37:02 EDT <arjunblj> If an action is economically rational, doesn't violate Bitcoin's consensus rules, and free market actors choose to risk trying it—it's perfectly compliant with Bitcoin's game theory.  This isn't "good" or "bad." Bitcoin isn't moral, it just is.

1126157358374293506 2019-05-08 12:10:11 EDT <martik> My conclusion. There was no hack at Binance at all. Binance, Bitfinex, Bittrex & some other exchanges draw large BTC amounts last 2 weeks. They work as one team. After IEO Bitfinex they're gonna dump Bitcoin. Time is to put end to all centralized exchanges.

1126132973202542599 2019-05-08 10:33:18 EDT <TusharJain_> 8/ Remember that Bitcoin is *only* as secure as the game theory bound economic incentives. And those incentives to secure the chain are getting drastically weaker over time, dropping by 90% over the next 10 years.
1126132965392752640 2019-05-08 10:33:16 EDT <TusharJain_> 1/ As the Bitcoin block reward drops by ~90% in the next 10 years, it would make it much easier to roll back the chain in the case of hacks such as the recent Binance hack.  In fact, this might become so common as to actually serve as a deterrent to future hacks.

1126106251056898053 2019-05-08 08:47:06 EDT <AaronvanW> BCH is learning the hard way that regular hard forks are a centralizing force.  After Bitcoin Classic and Bcash threw in the towel, and Bitcoin SV split off, Bitcoin XT is also calling it quits.  https://twitter.com/dgenr818/status/1125886137472413697 …
1126104434684174338 2019-05-08 08:39:53 EDT <thebitcoinrabbi> I spent $3 worth of bitcoin on a coffee last week, but the coffee wasn’t that great. I was thinking to reorg the blockchain to return my funds but have since decided not to.  Your Welcome.
1126103264875954178 2019-05-08 08:35:14 EDT <matt_odell> The reason bitcoin was stolen from binance and not any of the 100s of shitcoins they also offer is precisely because those chains are easy to rollback - or freeze - while bitcoin is not.  https://twitter.com/matt_odell/status/1126090083956940801 …
1126103020352221184 2019-05-08 08:34:16 EDT <xippix_xrp> BREAKING: BTC is officially declared as fraud!  Bitcoin is CENTRALISED Bitcoin in not immutable Bitcoin is prone to 51% attacks Bitcoin is not secure Bitcoin is not a “store of value” Bitcoin is completely worthless  #XRP #XRP #bitcoin #BitcoinCash #BitcoinSV #bitcoinrussia #BTC
1126101961353367553 2019-05-08 08:30:04 EDT <DahCryptkeeper> Let's clear up some FUD.  Binance is a centralized exchange. Binance was hacked. Binance is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized. Bitcoin did not get hacked.  Any questions?
1126101830805729280 2019-05-08 08:29:33 EDT <CobraBitcoin> One day everyone's acting like CZ is a hero for delisting BSV, the next he's getting relentlessly made fun of for being naive enough to think he can re-org the Bitcoin blockchain. You can pander to the mob all you like, but it will and can turn on you quick. Mobs are fickle.
1126101023599280128 2019-05-08 08:26:20 EDT <360_trader> $BTC doesn’t care that your exchange got hacked.  Long #Bitcoin, Short Exchanges?
1126101014237462528 2019-05-08 08:26:18 EDT <_Phil_Wilson_> That fact that the exchanges and miners and developers are stating they can nonchalantly roll back the main chain and expunge all the commerce which has taken place onchain since the hack shows BTC isn’t the real Bitcoin at all
1126100743679807490 2019-05-08 08:25:13 EDT <maxkeiser> The top job for humans is not to compete with #Bitcoin, but to survive Bitcoin. Bitcoin has established a path for cosmic intelligence to escape the stranglehold of humans and to flourish in purely electronic form.
1126100115570221056 2019-05-08 08:22:44 EDT <matt_odell> re: binance hack, blacklists, and wasabi  (1) Has become common practice for exchanges to block deposits from known hacks, not new. (2) If hackers know what they are doing it doesn't matter. (3) Using wasabi to mix more than 7k bitcoin is impractical. They'll use other methods.

1126097405458382848 2019-05-08 08:11:57 EDT <alansilbert> Ok, hold everything.  Woke up to this Bitcoin rollback/reorg nonsense.  Let's be clear:  1.  It's never going to happen. 2.  Even suggesting it as a possibility shows a real lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works. 3.  If possible, Bitcoin is broken.  Pack up and go home.
1126096917530701824 2019-05-08 08:10:01 EDT <jcho710> This is a $BTC log 3 day chart. Log charts have their uses, when % rises make prior history difficult to see. Here you can see the clear trendline BTC rode from 2015 on, that broke w the $6k break. Now BTC is back at resistance. This is a bull market? GL. #Bitcoin triple digits.  pic.twitter.com/N1zyHk4HHZ

1126092868085538818 2019-05-08 07:53:56 EDT <Dogetoshi> I, for one, think CZ should have attempted the reorg just so we can see Bitcoin rekt him.

1126091532518461440 2019-05-08 07:48:37 EDT <Jay_SPQR> I see people saying that 5/8/9 is a let down? The consequence of the Binance hack is exactly what is going to drive XRP to the top of the retail market   - Xrp flips above bitcoin - Everyone leaves bitcoin to join xrp - Bitcoin drops to $1k - Utility kicks in with Regs   🔥
1126091148282466304 2019-05-08 07:47:06 EDT <Dave_Jonez_02> Tether, BitFinex, Binance, Bitcoin chain re-organization...  Meanwhile, @Ripple is winning over the worlds' largest remittance networks and is invited to talks with central banks around the world.  Stop playing games and get $XRP.
1126088281005838336 2019-05-08 07:35:42 EDT <cz_binance> evaluating a suggested option is wrong in itself, especially under the circumstances. And under all circumstance, freedom of thought is not a crime. 3. we did not want to do it. 4. we couldn't do it.  Bitcoin is secure.  Onwards, lots to do...

1126041569633742850 2019-05-08 04:30:05 EDT <WhalePanda> An important lesson: now you know why certain people want their own altcoin with their own chain that they control (even though they claim it's decentralized). If they make a mistake, they can just bail themselves out. That won't happen with Bitcoin. Honey badger doesn't care.

1126028411544244224 2019-05-08 03:37:48 EDT <cambone> How does someone running an exchange not realize that immutability is supposed to be bitcoin's fundamental value proposition?  It would have forked the chain and tanked the price.  There's no way in hell "a roll back" would have been a profitable endeavor.  He must be delirious.

1126024257287405569 2019-05-08 03:21:18 EDT <PianoXr> GREED is the only feasible explanation for smart people justifying #Bitcoin’s existence right now.  It can no longer be defended on any fundamental front. It’s a *USE*LESS, MUTABLE, ENERGY-GUZZLING PILE OF SHIT!  I refuse to defend it just for the betterment of crypto adoption.
1126017646087102464 2019-05-08 02:55:01 EDT <MatiGreenspan> Oh come off it. CZ cannot reorg Bitcoin. Not even if he really wanted to.
1126016424672018433 2019-05-08 02:50:10 EDT <NischalShetty> Is a Bitcoin re-org possible?   Technically: Yes Practically: No  The majority of miners will have BTCs best interest at heart which is maintaining its persona of immutability.  In tech, everything is possible with the right incentives #bitcoin #btc
1126015683051966465 2019-05-08 02:47:13 EDT <VladZamfir> Truth is that reorgs are not prevented by the Bitcoin protocol (except against low hashrate mining coalitions), but instead by the social, legal, and political reality of the Bitcoin community  CZ says "pls", Bitcoiners say "no" and demand homage, so CZ says "ok! It's #immutable" https://twitter.com/codingupastorm/status/1125974097035317248 …

1126012724935319553 2019-05-08 02:35:28 EDT <ZLOK> The two important parts of this Binance hack:  1) Hackers stole Bitcoin. BTC. Not BCH, not Litecoin, not tokens, not anonymity coins, not Ethereum.   2) Binance's founder & CEO just learned now how Bitcoin works.  Don't leave your coins on exchanges. Not your keys not your coins!

1126008869174464513 2019-05-08 02:20:09 EDT <Mario_Gibney> If there's a 7000 btc transaction sitting there with very few confirmations, you'd better learn to accept that reorg risk is going to be pretty high until there's 7000 btc of work mined on top of it.  Welcome to Bitcoin. This is what your signed up for.  /end
1126008201294635008 2019-05-08 02:17:30 EDT <francispouliot_> Anybody who thinks reorging Bitcoin is even possible doesn't understand Bitcoin and anybody who is "thanking" @cz_binance for realizing this is as foolish as those who can think they can pull it off.   Read 👏 the 👏 whitepaper

1126002001093939200 2019-05-08 01:52:51 EDT <cz_binance> To put this to bed, it's not possible, bitcoin ledger is the most immutable ledger on the planet.  Done.  https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1125996194734399488 …
1125996226137038848 2019-05-08 01:29:54 EDT <real_vijay> Whatever good will CZ has won with the #Bitcoin community would be shattered if he attempted a chain reorg to make Binance whole. He won't do it. The risks both in a failed reorg attempt and destruction of their brand are far too high.
1125996197343154176 2019-05-08 01:29:48 EDT <cz_binance> cons: 1 we may damage credibility of BTC, 2 we may cause a split in both the bitcoin network and community. Both of these damages seems to out-weight $40m revenge. 3 the hackers did demonstrate certain weak points in our design and user confusion, that was not obvious before.
1125996196047118336 2019-05-08 01:29:47 EDT <cz_binance> pros: 1 we could "revenge" the hackers by "moving" the fees to miners; 2 deter future hacking attempts in the process. 3. explore the possibility of how bitcoin network would deal with situations like these.
1125996139675652096 2019-05-08 01:29:34 EDT <_prestwich> we got into Bitcoin to solve social coordination problems with free markets, without needing government intervention or violence  voluntarily cooperating to reorganize the chain to punish a thief fits the Bitcoin ethos perfectly
1125995462975160321 2019-05-08 01:26:53 EDT <mcnicollme> Is anyone familiar with how to use Coinjoin for #bitcoin and could give me some advice?   I’ve got 7,000 #BTC I want to clean.  Thanks.
1125995391889985536 2019-05-08 01:26:36 EDT <theonevortex> What kind of ridiculous headline is this? Binance doesn't control the #bitcoin network.  https://twitter.com/coindesk/status/1125988557494128641 …

1125993163536130049 2019-05-08 01:17:44 EDT <saifedean> In conclusion: learn better opsec.  Bitcoin isn't a shitcoin controlled by 5 people, and it isn't a central bank controlled by an oligopoly of banks looking out for themselves & democratic politicians looking to get reelected. This is hard money. There are no bailouts & do-overs.
1125990297413013504 2019-05-08 01:06:21 EDT <BitcoinErrorLog> There is no such thing as an exchange deciding to do a BTC rollback. CZ is talking out of his ass and you are making it worse with such a headline. Please don't make Bitcoin education harder than it already is.
1125990104638476288 2019-05-08 01:05:35 EDT <fudcrusher> So, rolling back the bitcoin network to undo the binance hack... I just about fell out of my chair when @cz_binance dropped that bomb. He said it could damage BTC, well I think that statement itself does enough! If CZ & allies could do that, shows BTC isn't decentralised at all.
1125988557494128641 2019-05-08 00:59:26 EDT <coindesk> Crypto exchange @binance founder and CEO @cz_binance said in an AMA the team is deciding on whether it will do a rollback on the bitcoin network following a $40 million hack on the exchange on Wednesday.  http://ow.ly/Dh6e50u2INM 
1125985809566449664 2019-05-08 00:48:31 EDT <saifedean> If this could be done auccessfully it would massively compromise bitcoin's entire value proposition.   It won't.   Bitcoin doesn't have a foundation & benevelont dictators. It's spontaneous order emerging from people acting out of self-interest, where collusion is dangerous.  https://twitter.com/JeremyRubin/status/1125919526485254144 …

1125972465623212039 2019-05-07 23:55:30 EDT <WhalePanda> No one is going to re-org the Bitcoin blockchain over this. 1) no bailout should ever be done, this isn' Ethereum 2) 7000 btc isn't that much for Binance (if they were honest about how much they are making) 3) play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

1125967991483486208 2019-05-07 23:37:43 EDT <theonevortex> 3/To even consider harming the main value propitiation of #bitcoin over a small $40m (peanuts compared to open market) fund transfer from phished api accounts (not a hack) that is already covered by the insurance fund of the exchange is completely insane.

1125966034253619200 2019-05-07 23:29:56 EDT <prestonjbyrne> Very much this. Bitcoin has survived far worse without the market demanding a re-org (Gox, Bitfinex hack).  https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1125964964605222912 …
1125965916779495424 2019-05-07 23:29:28 EDT <jaredctate> Wow.... CZ literally just proposed reorging the #bitcoin #blockchain to recover stollen #binance funds. That would completely undermine faith in $BTC immutability. And demonstrate how centralized BTC mining is. #DigiByte would never rollback for any reason.

You can’t seriously compare XRP with Bitcoin and expect anyone to fall for it.

Whole appeal of an ETF seemed to be an easy way to buy Bitcoin via a regular brokerage account. If it's easy to buy, then a Bitcoin ETF makes as much sense as a MSFT ETF

1125427768588668928 2019-05-06 11:51:04 EDT <notgrubles> Bcash would be worth a lot more if they had just embraced "bcash". No, you're never going to "take over" being Bitcoin; in name or any other way. Pounding the square peg that is "Bitcoin Cash" into the round hole that is the 2019 social-media-connected internet is futile.

1124830584071651328 2019-05-04 20:18:04 EDT <max_bronstein> Bitcoin is, across all features, a far better form of money than ETH. It’s more liquid, stable, and secure.  For ETH to become money, Dai would have to become the dominant form of credit in the crypto markets. ETH/DAI being the most liquid pair becomes the main conduit to debt.

1124822795592953857 2019-05-04 19:47:07 EDT <econoar> Bitcoin aspires to be gold but gold is cumbersome and inefficient to be day to day money.   Ether aspires to be money which can be programmable and used easily.   At the same time they have similar economic principals underneath.  Both have uses but I prefer ETH’s approach.

It holds back #crypto adoption.  $XRP https://twitter.com/tomothyjones/status/938939218893656065 …

1124290991698006017 2019-05-03 08:33:55 EDT <NischalShetty> Bitcoin will be the most democratic asset on Earth.  Over time, every human being will have a piece of it.   Why? Because it's easy to achieve this with Bitcoin compared to any physical asset or fiat.   Next time you find someone without BTC, send them a Satoshi!  #bitcoin #btc

1124286597057470464 2019-05-03 08:16:27 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> Remember when the Tether peg broke last October, how Bitfinex clients rushed into Bitcoin to GTFO, everybody else saw Bitcoin pumping on Bitfinex and FOMOed in, only to get wiped out a month later when Bitcoin crashed by 50%?  Well, this time is completely different. For reasons.

1124285947888246788 2019-05-03 08:13:52 EDT <pourteaux> Facebook Coin is basically a bitcoin L2 for when you don't need immutability or privacy and just wanna split dim sum eight ways with your friends. Basically American WeChat. I see this as complementary to Bitcoin (an on ramp) and adversarial to payment coins (XLM, BCH, etc).

1124282256271519745 2019-05-03 07:59:12 EDT <paddystash> The #bitcoin market cap pushing above $100 million is probably the most significant part of this move up here. Why? Because everybody's talking about it, and it will attract no-coiners into the space..  New retail money entering the market = a higher priced $BTC 🚀🚀🚀
1124280746707963904 2019-05-03 07:53:12 EDT <WallSt_Dropout> When #Bitcoin hits $20k, the FOMO will be unlike anything we've seen.

1124190061434589184 2019-05-03 01:52:51 EDT <BCHcain> The best part of Bitcoin Cash is being able to give it to anyone, anywhere, instantly, freely, because it's censorship resistant + high-fee resistant. It allows for easy distribution of money to those who show proof of work. Bitcoin Cash, it's the hyperloop of money. @elonmusk
