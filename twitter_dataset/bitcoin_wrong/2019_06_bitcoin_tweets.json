1145117513002422283 2019-06-29 19:51:05 EDT <DrBitcoinMD> The reason goldbugs are so bitter about Bitcoin is because they have been the sound money enthusiasts warning of fiat currency for decades. They have become so entrenched in their cognitive bias, they dismiss the revolutionary innovation which solves the problems gold could not.

1145091864124674050 2019-06-29 18:09:09 EDT <lowstrife> Bitcoin and other crypto's will continue to get harder to trade as higher ELO players continue to join the market.

You can't just disregard the best money humanity had for thousands of years because a new form is theoretically better.

The $6.16 network fee is a nice fee to pay if you believe in Bitcoin. Much better than #IOTA because there the miners lose their job. Bitcoin is the future.

1145009575520821249 2019-06-29 12:42:10 EDT <simonlutz21> 6/ We're talking about Bitcoin and the way information in its public ledger is made immutable. A new block of information is only accepted if the creator provably burnt a massive amount of energy. This may seem wasteful at first glance, but it's actually a useful megastructure.

1144684949582336000 2019-06-28 15:12:13 EDT <krugermacro> Leverage is good. Through leverage is how some make fortunes with real estate, for example. Excessive leverage however can be deadly. The more volatile prices are, the less leverage should be employed. As everyone knows, house prices are considerably less volatile than bitcoin's.

1144647013394452480 2019-06-28 12:41:29 EDT <Rhythmtrader> Bitcoin's supply is transparent, and the demand is apparent.
1144645783737606145 2019-06-28 12:36:35 EDT <nathanielpopper> Everyone is attributing Bitcoin's recent rise to Libra, but it may in fact be another stablecoin that is more responsible -- Tether.  @matthewde_silva digs into a hypothesis that I've also heard from some serious traders. https://qz.com/1654449/is-tether-a-factor-in-bitcoins-price-surge/ …

1144643502472683520 2019-06-28 12:27:32 EDT <nlw> The question of whether Bitcoin makes the world better or worse probably isn’t the right one.   Instead, it might be better to ask if it makes it more or less stable.   The answer is likely less, but in the way that times are always less stable when power shifts from few to many

1144635167476199424 2019-06-28 11:54:24 EDT <amlivemon> The reason populism and fads like Bitcoin have become popular in a cult like atmosphere is the fact that the public wants control they see slipping away to a select few. The public wants disorder to establish a new order. Trump, Bitcoin, Brexit, etc are symptoms, not causes.  https://twitter.com/amlivemon/status/1144626042298077185 …

1144610444084219904 2019-06-28 10:16:10 EDT <PeterSchiff> In 2017 Bitcoin's loss of market share to altcoins was hailed as being bullish for Bitcoin, as it evidenced broader crypto adoption.  Now, as Bitcoin regains that lost market dominance, this too is being hailed as bullish for Bitcoin, as it proves that Bitcoin is digital gold.
1144608908238917633 2019-06-28 10:10:04 EDT <APompliano> Bitcoin is immune to social, political, or economic pressures.  This makes it incredibly anti-fragile.

1144601390779703296 2019-06-28 09:40:11 EDT <coinyeezy> The most fascinating BitCoin event to me is the Block Reward halving coming in May 2020.   Since the miner subsidy will be reduced, miners will seek more revenue from new sources.   One interesting thing to note: BSV halving is 45 days before the BTC halving. 👀
1144601389504630784 2019-06-28 09:40:11 EDT <coinyeezy> As expected, BitCoin as the World Computer (BSV) is maturing as a protocol.

1143969551555661824 2019-06-26 15:49:29 EDT <YORK780> You know why this Bitcoin bullrun is not a bubble like in 2017? Because shit altcoins arent going up as well. Bitcoin is being bought with a purpose. Not blindly buying all the coins like 2017. Big longterm investors instead of retail CNBC ‘buy everything’ plebs.

1143967440235372551 2019-06-26 15:41:06 EDT <MascMillennial> Twitter is funny.  Respectable, successful men can acknowledge when you make a great point.  Then a guy with an anime girl holding a Bitcoin will call you an incel on the same tweet.
1143967291626930177 2019-06-26 15:40:30 EDT <Technom4ge> #Bitcoin is up 20% today! This is rare, even for bitcoin. Huge rally. Or yuge, as someone would say. My advice is to stay level-headed and keep in mind that such a high volatility can also lead to steep corrections.

1143956758869630976 2019-06-26 14:58:39 EDT <jaredctate> 5) I advise people to start their journey into crypto by looking at truly decentralized #UTXO projects first such as #Bitcoin #Litecoin #DigiByte and then to start further researching projects one by one. $VTC $DCR $DOGE $ETH are good time tested #blockchain’s as well to research
1143956756306878465 2019-06-26 14:58:39 EDT <jaredctate> 3) Then I explain #DigiByte uses 5 independent mining algorithms for greater decentralization & security while #bitcoin uses 1 that has a high barrier to entry for beginner miners.
1143956755040231424 2019-06-26 14:58:38 EDT <jaredctate> 2) I get asked all the time the biggest differences between #bitcoin & #DigiByte. Speed is where I start. $BTC has 10-minute blocks while $DGB has 15 second blocks. So DGB blocks occur 40x faster and more often to handle more transactions.
1143956596663508992 2019-06-26 14:58:00 EDT <SGTreport> Not sure how many of you follow the cryptos, but Bitcoin is rapidly closing in on $14,000. BTC has nearly doubled since June 4th.

1143946302998188032 2019-06-26 14:17:06 EDT <balajis> Bitcoin does make one think about the great person theory of history.

Maybe just in time.

I would recommend @trezor wallets (with an additional passphrase!) with @CasaHODL multisig setup for the best user experience.

1143473198597660672 2019-06-25 06:57:09 EDT <paddypisa> bitcoin isn't censorship resistant because it is "decentralised".   it avoids censorship because it prioritises liveness over safety.  Care about "permissionless" - anyone can buy hardware to produce blocks and keep bitcoin live.  kill one miner? another miner will replace them.

1143255081371832320 2019-06-24 16:30:26 EDT <parabolictrav> Bitcoin’s best price performance existed prior to the development of any financial infrastructure where debt could “inflate” it (2009-2013).   It’s price behaviour is something completely different.  Calling it a “bubble” is just ignorance.
1143255077081063424 2019-06-24 16:30:25 EDT <parabolictrav> Bubbles are fueled by direct credit expansion benefiting a specific sector in an imbalanced way, encouraging malinvestment. Bitcoin benefiting from the Fed easing credit in this direct manner is utterly false.

You were motivated for wanting to change the world. As much as we wanted #bitcoin to grow in value we knew it may never and that was OK.

1143235614285975553 2019-06-24 15:13:05 EDT <connolly_dan> I see the original Bitcoin software as a proof-of-concept implementation. Best practice is to discard the proof-of-concept when it has served its purpose and start properly from scratch.  Instead, we've built on this proof-of-concept code for 10 years, and it shows.

1143224496934903808 2019-06-24 14:28:54 EDT <fundstrat> If an investor allocated 2% of his portfolio to #bitcoin, this TINY allocation would have added 400bp to his overall return.

But stock and bond prices are also rising.  Bitcoin and stocks are rising as speculative assets, while gold and bonds are rising as safe havens.

I think the price of silver is spring coiled for a major move to $20-25 and I’ve been buying more silver at these levels. I suspect the move will occur in congress with a deflating of alt coins and perhaps bitcoin.

1143173998496440320 2019-06-24 11:08:15 EDT <drex_jurassic> Bitcoin maximalism exists because Bitcoin is still (not even by a close margin) the BEST. Maximalists are not “toxic” because they dislike or want other projects to fail, it’s because the killer app is already here and has been with us for over 10 years now. Long BTC🦖🦖🦖
1143171953521516544 2019-06-24 11:00:07 EDT <Davincij15> The same applies for all assets on this planet you have made no rational argument and you know it.  You are acting intellectually dishonest.  Bitcoin promises nothing it exits a limited scarce commodity people can trade or store information on the BTC blockchain.

1143170727455133696 2019-06-24 10:55:15 EDT <HammerToe> That video is about Libra. Nothing to do with XRP. As you know XRP is decentralised, and just as mucha 'currency for the people' as Bitcoin is. Probabaly more so, in that it can actually be used daily by a wider part of the world.

1143139277531963393 2019-06-24 08:50:16 EDT <JamesTodaroMD> Many interpret Bitcoin’s explosive rise over the past 2 months as confirmation of two things:  1) Bitcoin still leads the market.  2) Altcoins are (essentially) dead.  The first is true, the latter is not.  Retail can’t help it. Buying altcoins is in their nature.

1143119035560804355 2019-06-24 07:29:50 EDT <PeterSchiff> This article's claim that Schiff Gold accepts payment in Bitcoin is part of the ongoing fraud to misrepresent Bitcoin as a medium of exchange.  Schiff Gold works with Bitpay which allows Bitcoin owners to sell Bitcoin for dollars.  Schiff Gold then receives dollars, not Bitcoin.

1143117059724894208 2019-06-24 07:21:59 EDT <PeterSchiff> Bitcoin is not hard money, and has nothing to do with gold's recent rally.  If anything digital fool's gold has taken some of the shine off the real thing. But that will be short-lived.  This article is extremely biased, like all of the coverage of me from the crypto community.

1143070396012302336 2019-06-24 04:16:34 EDT <real_vijay> 10/ #Bitcoin's hype cycles seem to have a life of their own and do not seem to be affected meaningfully by good news (in bear markets) or bad news (in bull markets). It does appear, however, that the Bitcoin halving is a key fundamental driver of Bitcoin's monetization.
1143070394804391937 2019-06-24 04:16:33 EDT <real_vijay> 9/ And so it has been with our current nascent bull market. Past experience has shown that the #Bitcoin market begins its upward ascent about a year before the halving, and about a year after the halving goes parabolic. But markets anticipate, so this make happen faster this time
1143070392292007942 2019-06-24 04:16:33 EDT <real_vijay> 7/ After a halving, the equilibrium demand of HODLers now exceeds miner sell supply, tending to move #Bitcoin's price upward. The upward price action then slowly but surely feeds on itself and triggers the next bull market as new entrants are lured into an inevitable frenzy.
1143070191582162944 2019-06-24 04:15:45 EDT <RobPrice58> And some wonder why they're interest in gold and bitcoin... Because you can't store your value in cash, bonds or mortgages.

1142725099390492677 2019-06-23 05:24:29 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> Bitcoin bagholders aren’t dumb enough to believe Bitcoin isn’t a negative sum pyramid scheme.

1142725097054265344 2019-06-23 05:24:28 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> Bitcoin bagholders believe that when crypto exchanges start getting their assets seized, when exit scam “hacks” start happening on an hourly basis, THEY will be able to somehow withdraw their money before the exchange operators, who will of course for some reason let them do it.

1142690614624083969 2019-06-23 03:07:27 EDT <SimonDixonTwitt> The very first time I heard about #Bitcoin $BTC and the story of how I got involved https://www.pscp.tv/w/b98XQjFsWktwZWxvbllqbm18MUx5eEJBUm1kZWtKTgQZ1wa1WBmG7YZs10xLXEUV8le8a-Jk4IY2-Weedad0 …
1142690528808636416 2019-06-23 03:07:06 EDT <Xentagz> I wonder why @PeterSchiff is talking shit about #bitcoin 🤣
1142690022799187968 2019-06-23 03:05:06 EDT <sthenc> That’s what you’re not getting, Peter: we’re going to Bitcoin, and we’re never coming back.   #hyperbitcoinization https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1142424629677613056 …
1142689963076489217 2019-06-23 03:04:52 EDT <NicolasDorier> If you like trading, the best indicator I know is: Sell when your Bitcoin unrelated friends/family start asking you questions about Bitcoin.  I don't sell, but if you want to, this is better indicator than any technical analysis.
1142687338071392256 2019-06-23 02:54:26 EDT <LomahCrypto> So much fear and bearishness on alts in my mentions.  Would be a shame if altcoins pump off of this dump extremely quickly, leaving most sideline investors stuck in bitcoin.

1142676699449966597 2019-06-23 02:12:09 EDT <G0JlRA> With cryptocurrency like $BTC $NANO $BNB, you'll be able to #hodl and afford more #Libra over time. On the other hand, holding Libra will not net you more #Bitcoin, @nano or @binance coin in the long term... The same way holding fiat currency isn't a good store of value.
1142670456828227584 2019-06-23 01:47:21 EDT <Ragnarly> Anyone can buy bitcoin. $5 at a time if that's all they have. For perhaps 1st time in history the disadvantaged have access to the greatest investment in generations  If that's not opportunity for anyone I don't know what is. You're a virtue signalling moron who never grokked BTC
1142669924629798912 2019-06-23 01:45:14 EDT <real_vijay> The vast majority of gold's price is monetary premium, just like Bitcoin.  Industrial use does not protect that premium in any way. The premium is based on suitability as a store of value where Bitcoin excels over even gold.  pic.twitter.com/LXngwYxvDN
1142669024930586624 2019-06-23 01:41:39 EDT <visvak> I own a miniscule amount of bitcoin and it's basically like supporting a terrible sports team. No hope of glory ever, but very occasionally, it'll give you some stupid false hope that'll make your day marginally better.

They also like to argue that it will never happen because BTC is limited supply and ETH isn't but are also forgetting the difficulty bomb and PoS will limit it by 2021.

Bulls are likely to target further gains & just like the 2017 bull-run, price might soon accelerate above $11,200. https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/06/23/bitcoin-price-tops-11-2k-btc-could-rise-again/ …

1142633884166893568 2019-06-22 23:22:01 EDT <matt_odell> Bitcoin is a new type of money that is digital and independent of world governments or corporations. It is hard to seize, block, or inflate and easy to send around the world.  It is the best money we have ever had. As more people realize this, the price should rise.

1142606411530006529 2019-06-22 21:32:51 EDT <CoinstorageGuru> @PeterSchiff How would you feel about using Bitcoin as a transactional medium for trading gold? I’m one of the original members of @Tokenized_com who together created a fast, cheap and reliable way of exchanging tokens of all kinds using Bitcoin. This includes gold certificates.
1142603984797966337 2019-06-22 21:23:13 EDT <CoinstorageGuru> Bitcoin and gold can work together. Most gold is held in vaults and exchanged with certificates. Bitcoin can create the simplest, fastest and cheapest gold certificate exchange in the world using Tokenized on #BitcoinSV. Would love to tell you more as I think you’ll understand.

1142602778080141313 2019-06-22 21:18:25 EDT <pierre_rochard> Yes: 1. Having a target bitcoin allocation 2. DCA accumulating until you hit that target (might be forever #stackingsats!) 3. Holding 4. Rebalancing, selling bitcoin when you’re over-allocated (eg you get paid in bitcoin or its value increased too much)  No: 1. Timing the market
1142601938552463361 2019-06-22 21:15:05 EDT <BitcoinTina> What Peter Schiff really does not understand is that unlike gold #Bitcoin won't have to be sold for Fiat!  https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1142424629677613056 …

1142598381757329408 2019-06-22 21:00:57 EDT <MichellePhan> You can buy BTC in fraction, called Satoshi. Each bitcoin is divisible to the 8th decimal place. Each BTC can be split into 100,000,000 pieces. If you have $1 you can buy a Satoshi.  https://twitter.com/elleameno_p/status/1142594856667222016 …
1142597117359415297 2019-06-22 20:55:55 EDT <MarkHar13514700> Many don’t understand the melt up in software stocks, but very few emotionally attack such companies. Why is it so many pundits who don’t understand the value of digital scarcity  attack #bitcoin? These pied piper pundits have cost their followers fortunes.
1142597070676811776 2019-06-22 20:55:44 EDT <ArminVanBitcoin> The plan is simple. Accumulate sats, buy #bitcoin and hodl. In the meantime, read books like "The Bitcoin Standard", "Mastering Bitcoin" and "Programming Bitcoin". Never stop learning. Bitcoin evolves faster than you can learn. Don't trade, stay humble and exercise regularly! 🏋️
1142592718125666310 2019-06-22 20:38:27 EDT <MichellePhan> If you bought 1000 Bitcoin when it was at $1, they’d be worth 10 million dollars today. Let that sink in.

1142584965260955650 2019-06-22 20:07:38 EDT <TraderScarface> Here’s how it will go down..   Bitcoin will bear trap around all time high. Once it smashes through the high your next door neighbour will become a crypto know-it-all over night.  They’ll then proceed to buy the $400 Bitcoin, the $200 Bitcoin and the $1 Bitcoin.

1142583904362098688 2019-06-22 20:03:25 EDT <LandM_Marius> 1. You own a gold company 2. One of the mutual funds u manage is gold (I’m in that fund) 3. You literally hate Bitcoin & those who invest in it 4. You’ve lost credibility & it’s going to be difficult to get it back.  You see Peter, you’ve been condescending towards us for years.
1142583381286432768 2019-06-22 20:01:20 EDT <barrysilbert> $8 trillion in gold -> $8 trillion in bitcoin would unlock countless productive uses of that capital, would transfer wealth to a new generation of innovators and -- no doubt -- would dramatically increase economic opportunity for all (well, except the gold bugs)

1142579511818510336 2019-06-22 19:45:58 EDT <MichellePhan> Bitcoin was created with the intent to create a better money with the tools we have today. The monetary theory behind BTC is what makes it valuable. Learn about what money is, and you’ll understand why BTC is important. Good luck hodlers.  pic.twitter.com/SzJFd4wWvL

1142566568330715136 2019-06-22 18:54:32 EDT <PeterSchiff> Bitcoin bugs claim the only reason I am pro gold is that I have a gold company or that one of the mutual funds I manage is a gold fund.  Yet they ignore the greater bias of those shilling for Bitcoin, who own huge personal stakes, manage crypto funds, or own crypto businesses!

1142518655651065856 2019-06-22 15:44:09 EDT <thecjpearson> Question:   Is bitcoin traded like stocks? Like you buy Bitcoin while low and sell it when it’s high in exchange for actual cash?   Or is Bitcoin not exchangeable for hard currency?

1142491226140286976 2019-06-22 13:55:09 EDT <ZubyMusic> Many people believe that pounds and dollars are still backed by gold.  They're not.  They haven't been for many decades...  Learn what money is first and how it works before you try to understand bitcoin.  If you don't understand money, you won't understand bitcoin.

1142480955547873280 2019-06-22 13:14:20 EDT <Ragnarly> I've heard every argument against bitcoin, repeatedly. I no longer will respond or can care.   Bitcoin's financial upside, cypherpunk functionality, and tech innovation is so overwhelming I can barely keep up as it.   Distractions are attack vectors for success in bitcoin. 🖤🖤🖤

Those of you in the old school who believe this is a bubble simply have not understood the new mathematics of the Blockchain, or you did not care enough to try. Bubbles are mathematically impossible in this new paradigm. So are corrections and all else.

1142471224322220032 2019-06-22 12:35:40 EDT <MagicPoopCannon> The reason why I like XRP, is because it's a counter play to Bitcoin and conventional cryptos. Think about it. Many cryptos threaten to dismantle the global financial system as we know it. However, @Ripple is working WITH the system. From an investment POV, it's a safety play.
1142470693541548038 2019-06-22 12:33:34 EDT <spencernoon> So what’s causing this recent #Bitcoin run-up?  Retail investment indicators like tweets are still at low levels, which suggests this rise is likely due to some combo of (i) institutions accumulating and (ii) actual SoV usage in places like Iran/Hong Kong—both encouraging signs.  pic.twitter.com/bzP8c8xVYY

1142437343539933185 2019-06-22 10:21:02 EDT <Nicholas_Merten> I love you Peter, but you and I both know gold didn't get its value from its industrial applications. Dentistry wasn't the "killer" use case of gold hundreds of years ago and electronics aren't either. It provided a way to store and transmit value. Bitcoin can do it just as well.  https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1142425757865697282 …

1142429492624932871 2019-06-22 09:49:51 EDT <WhiteRabbitBTC> Hi Peter.  Bitcoin hodl'er since 2013 here.  I bought my house and several cars with the money i've made from bitcoin.  In fact, to date my gains are around 166x.  You know what that same investment in gold would have bought me?  A -22% loss of funds.
1142429322298429440 2019-06-22 09:49:10 EDT <krugermacro> This year gold pushed into 6 year highs. Meanwhile, $BTC is up +12% overnight. Bitcoin moved more in a single night than gold moved in six years.  https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1142073769307049984 …

1142399135481573376 2019-06-22 07:49:13 EDT <Khil0ne> When people start to believe an altseason won’t happen and Bitcoin will keep going you know its around the corner.  People will panic, capitulate their alts for Bitcoin and after that Bitcoin will correct while altseason starts.  Altseason is the best way to accumulate Bitcoin.

1142267031447752705 2019-06-21 23:04:17 EDT <NicolasDorier> The thing that is awesome with Bitcoin, is that it is easy to convince yourself it is safe by reviewing the design yourself without being cryptographer. The math part (EC, hash functions) are the only assumptions you rely on, which is fine as nobody broke it for decades.

Bakkt wasn't launching with it. Microsoft wasn't building on it. TD Ameritrade wasn't trading it. Facebook wasn't competing with it.

1142103453667385344 2019-06-21 12:14:17 EDT <udiWertheimer> I strongly believe that if Bitcoin was being designed today, with the knowledge we have now, it would’ve had much stronger privacy features.  Weak privacy only hurts the good guys. The bad guys will always find ways to hide, because they have financial incentive to do so.

1142073637127647233 2019-06-21 10:15:48 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> If you are like me #Bitcoin is probably all you can think about right now but the reality is 99% of people are totally tuned out. They either think BTC is dead or inactive. Most of them will get a rude awakening when they finally notice what's been happening lately.
1142073069147697152 2019-06-21 10:13:33 EDT <Josh_Rager> Most the money this cycle will flow into: -Bitcoin -Major market cap alts -New altcoins released in 2019/2020  Accumulating altcoins from 2017/early 2018 likely won't present you with the most ROI  Especially if your coin is illiquid & not already in the top 200 to 300 market cap
1142072879531487233 2019-06-21 10:12:47 EDT <BitcoinBrains> I'm completely open to the idea that a better form of money than #Bitcoin could emerge and cause the global consensus around a single form of hard money to switch.  It wouldn't be predictable.  I'm also completely sure that none of the other coins which exist now could do that.

1141874767525318656 2019-06-20 21:05:34 EDT <LomahCrypto> I remember the feeling at $3,500 Bitcoin, when people said they were waiting for the capitulation lower.  I kind of have that feeling with alts, now that I see people calling for extinctions of projects or waiting for more capitulation.  The bottom is so obvious in hindsight.
1141874159447920640 2019-06-20 21:03:09 EDT <ThinkingCrypto1> I hold and I'm bullish on both #Bitcoin & #XRP - what's interesting is the Banks & Governments seem more afraid of Facebook's #Libra than they are of Bitcoin. Alot people say BTC is suppose to take down the Banks etc. Most likely because a lot of the Banks have accumulated BTC

Every low is a buying opportunity with targets at $10,000 & $12,000.  https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/06/20/bitcoin-btc-defying-gravity-up-15-with-libra-tailwinds/ …

1141788971158122498 2019-06-20 15:24:38 EDT <RonnieMoas> I expect #bitcoin to jump by $1,000-$2,000 per month for the next 6-12 months. Understand that a $1,000 move on $10,000 is 10% ... and on $20,000 it requires only 5%. This would put $BTC at ~ $15,000-$30,000 ...

Also, one prominent investor claims that Bitcoin is rapidly becoming a hedge to the U.S. dollar & other fiat monies.  https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/06/20/crypto-investor-claims-federal-reserve-outlet-is-brazenly-bullish-for-bitcoin/ …

The market does not care about how bearish any smart individual is. Very intelligent people often over think it and thus make for terrible speculators.

1141661284708036613 2019-06-20 06:57:15 EDT <brucefenton> Strong projects, like Bitcoin are attacked mercilessly, argued about endlessly, criticized, investigated for vulnerabilities and exhaustively researched.  It combines computer science with economics in an open setting.  The adversarial nature of this is what makes Bitcoin strong.

1141642372943634432 2019-06-20 05:42:07 EDT <adam3us> Also Bitcoin is permissionless, censorship-resistant, unseizable and unfreezable. In other words it is both global electronic cash and investable asset. Seems to me Libra will be more a "tokenized" user interface for a PayPal / WeChat Pay-alike with bank account like properties.

1141599567026294785 2019-06-20 02:52:01 EDT <real_vijay> 10/ Very few people correctly anticipate how high the market will go and most will be shocked by the final peak. This is the bull market when #Bitcoin achieves geopolitical significance, so everyone will be watching. The feeding frenzy may be like nothing we've ever seen.
1141599564534865920 2019-06-20 02:52:00 EDT <real_vijay> 9/ One sure sign a #Bitcoin bull market is coming to an end is the sloppiness of the trading. Large inter-exchange spreads, major price "gaps", and the inability of exchanges to stay open during the mad final rush of profit-motivated speculators are major warning signs.
1141599561955389441 2019-06-20 02:52:00 EDT <real_vijay> 8/ There will be several moments during the bull market where major corrections will mistakenly be called "tops". Several prominent commentators made the mistake of calling tops for #Bitcoin at $5000, $9000 and $15,000 in the prior bull. The same will happen again in this run.

1141310817998114816 2019-06-19 07:44:38 EDT <AriDavidPaul> 2/ there’s a small tail risk that in blocking Libra, regulators may also make things tougher on permissionless cryptocurrencies.  This is the only way I see Libra (indirectly) possibly hurting Bitcoin.
1141310468423901184 2019-06-19 07:43:14 EDT <AriDavidPaul> I have no special insights, but my best guess is that Libra is 50/50 to ever launch.  There’s dozens of different legislative and regulatory authorities that will explore blocking it.  Bitcoin and other permissionless cryptocurrencies win to it launching.

Its currency will never be a global money accessible to everyone & it will be opposed by others. Only Bitcoin can be a neutral international protocol

1141261516718653440 2019-06-19 04:28:43 EDT <LarssonFuture> What makes you think it will be available in India?   Facebook will disable the feature in India, if that is what the government requires. Bitcoin is a better bet.

1141257292744187904 2019-06-19 04:11:56 EDT <newscientist> It is not yet clear what degree of control founding organisations of Libra will have over the cryptocurrency. The value of the best-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has been volatile in recent years  https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24132162-900-it-now-costs-more-to-make-bitcoin-than-the-cryptocurrency-is-worth/ …
1141255318590119936 2019-06-19 04:04:06 EDT <Beautyon_> Like bcash, Panopticoin may gain users but it will never beat Bitcoin. Just as Linux and Open Source software powers everything under the hood now, Bitcoin will do the same for money on the Internet.   The Internet is bigger than Facebook.
1141255316753002496 2019-06-19 04:04:05 EDT <Beautyon_> Bitcoin will always be  Technically superior Faster Better scaling Absolutely secure Politically neutral Uncensorable Permissionless Trustworthy Transparent Fair and Democratic Private  Bcash & Panopticoin can never be any of those .

1141253460383412224 2019-06-19 03:56:43 EDT <udiWertheimer> One thing bitcoin achieved and remains largely misunderstood: network of independent exchanges, which sort of comply with regulations, sort of have serviceable relationships with banks, can move money globally  ICOs leveraged that in 2017, Facebook seeks to leverage that in 2020
1141253069243424768 2019-06-19 03:55:09 EDT <balajis> Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition is seizure resistance. It is property as cryptography, a form of wealth that cannot be seized by the state. It protects against inflation scenarios like Venezuela and Weimar, and seizure scenarios like the Russian and Cuban revolutions.
1141252259629522944 2019-06-19 03:51:56 EDT <ThinkingUSD> The world is moving so fast. It feels like just a couple months ago everyone assumed bitcoin was dead and cryptocurrency to be a joke, now facebook launching #libra and the whole world is paying attention.

1141239188844507136 2019-06-19 03:00:00 EDT <eth_classic> When #Bitcoin started to grow in popularity, one of its great promises was the ability to program money and accounts, enabling agreements, using #smart_contracts.  #Spaaw - Spreadsheet as a Wallet via @MyEtherplan #EthereumClassic #ClassicIsComing https://etherplan.com/2019/06/17/spaaw-spreadsheet-as-a-wallet/7728/#.XQhPVvjj--c.twitter …
1141237700512477184 2019-06-19 02:54:05 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> IMHO the big difference between #libracoin and #Bitcoin is transparency. With BTC there is no ulterior motive hidden from view. No one trying to gain control over your money. No one to lock you out. No one to suddenly change the rules. With BTC What You See Is What You Get.

It instead competes with other centralized blockchains like Tron, EOS, Cardano, Neo, Icon, Ripple, and Stellar and will likely make them obsolete. Only buy BTC and ETH.

1141064123662270464 2019-06-18 15:24:21 EDT <ErikVoorhees> 14/ Over the long term, any currency based on fiat will fail relative to hard assets (Bitcoin, gold, etc.) Politicians debase currency as their modus operandi, and thus if Libra maintains fiat backing it tend toward zero long term. BTC and “real” cryptos will crush it long term.

It's CENTRALIZED and NOT an ASSET but uses #BLOCKCHAIN TECH.  It CAN NOT compete with #BITCOIN, #ETHEREUM and MOST ALTCOINS.  It will get #CRYPTO a lot of attention.  #massadoption
1141031671657054208 2019-06-18 13:15:24 EDT <VentureCoinist> In an alt market where most tokens are dropping vs bitcoin, the gains of 40-70% in early June for $FET, $MATIC, $ONE, & $CELR stand out.  They've retraced for the past week.  Today - all 4 tokens are up 5-15%. Worth keeping an eye on whether the IEO tokens can trend higher again. pic.twitter.com/Uspjg8tEUd

1141011147039989760 2019-06-18 11:53:51 EDT <peter> One thing Libra has going for it is backing from good developers & UX folks.   As transformative as bitcoin has been, it has a user interface problem. It’s hard enough for “normals” to get a bank account. Forget about managing private keys or “cold storage”.  7/

1140974404026998785 2019-06-18 09:27:50 EDT <spencernoon> Facebook’s Libra gives Bitcoin and permissionless cryptocurrencies more credibility than they’ve ever had before. Regardless of how you feel about Libra, this is a seminal moment towards mainstream adoption.

1140973436698804224 2019-06-18 09:24:00 EDT <TuurDemeester> Now that it's clear that the way forward for stablecoins is to be fully "asset backed", we can see how Bitcoin could be let in through the backdoor, as an addition to the reserve in order to preserve the token's value in the face of inflation. #LibraCoin

1140962955846180864 2019-06-18 08:42:21 EDT <saifedean> In the short-run, Libra will only survive by being subservient to the USD & pegged to it. In the long-run, it will only survive by being subservient to bitcoin and pegged to it. The only other fate possible is the life & inevitable death of yet another irrelevant stupid shitcoin.
1140962859846918150 2019-06-18 08:41:58 EDT <maxkeiser> Libra doesn’t compete with #Bitcoin. It competes with other fiat.   It’s private currency vs. state currency. (The first time this has been possible globally via blockchain’ish tech).   Let $FB take out banks/central banks leaving BTC free to grab Gold’s market as SOV.
1140962654888112129 2019-06-18 08:41:09 EDT <saifedean> So, if govts let it, Libra will likely kill most KYC/AML fiat processors & currencies, producing a global digital payment system based on USD. The problems it'll face then are the same problems faced by any political monetary system, to which bitcoin is the only working solution.
1140962323642892289 2019-06-18 08:39:50 EDT <saifedean> FB shouldn't think of itself as competing with Bitcoin, as that's how they'll becoming an irrelevant stupid shitcoin like the thousands we have. In the long-run, Bitcoin represents the only chance for FB to build Libra on a global neutral protocol, and not on a political currency

1140960974201114626 2019-06-18 08:34:28 EDT <ArminVanBitcoin> Libra will be backed by the USD, a currency that has lost more than 99% of its value to #bitcoin in the last 10 years. Why it is called a "stablecoin" boggles my mind. Maybe they mean "stable" as in a horse stable... you know, the thing your horse takes a shit in? 🤔🐴💩

1140952708146520065 2019-06-18 08:01:38 EDT <TamasBlummer> Libra resembles Ethereum more than Bitcoin.

1140947175599419392 2019-06-18 07:39:39 EDT <fluffypony> Every open-source project starts out centralised, and some become decentralised (like Bitcoin) because they’re intended to decouple from their creator. Libra is clearly not intended to decouple ever.

1140941508457009152 2019-06-18 07:17:07 EDT <JoelKatz> This is why it doesn't really matter how centralized bitcoin mining happens to be. As soon as it stops producing the results the users want, they can change the mining algorithm, switch to PoS, or change the rules however they want to get the results they want.
1140940931010424832 2019-06-18 07:14:50 EDT <JoelKatz> If stakeholders were free to change the consensus algorithm however they wanted, they could choose a set of known validators for as long as that produced the results they want, just as bitcoin stakeholders currently like SHA256d/PoW's results. 1/2
1140940899884646404 2019-06-18 07:14:42 EDT <CryptoMichNL> And yes, on the radio in the news:  ‘Facebook announced their cryptocurrency called Libra.’   In the end it’s good that the momentum keeps going & people talk about crypto and decentralization.

1140939806903549953 2019-06-18 07:10:22 EDT <giacomozucco> Meh. If it will really compete with central banks, it will be shut down eventually. If it will not be shut down, then the assumption that central banks are a political cartel is wrong, Bitcoin is not needed, and we can use some efficient e-gold instead.
1140939182665113600 2019-06-18 07:07:53 EDT <gaborgurbacs> Yes. The Libra-killer was unveiled 10y+ ago and it’s called Bitcoin.
1140938497936822273 2019-06-18 07:05:10 EDT <Rhythmtrader> Facebook's Libra will cause people to question the properties of the US Dollar and how the banking system works.  And as we all know, once you begin to question it, all roads lead to bitcoin.

1140924163705778176 2019-06-18 06:08:12 EDT <APompliano> The most important part of the Facebook announcement is that every user of a Facebook property will get a digital wallet eventually.  Almost 1/3 of the world will be onboarded to cryptocurrencies.  This is incredibly bullish for Bitcoin.
1140922553759883265 2019-06-18 06:01:48 EDT <DeaterBob> Unpopular opinion:  Libra has a higher probability of being “banned” by government than bitcoin does.

1140919592166014977 2019-06-18 05:50:02 EDT <alistairmilne> Sell Libra, buy Bitcoin
1140919326960230400 2019-06-18 05:48:59 EDT <WhalePanda> After reading some more stuff about Libra I am even more bullish on Bitcoin.

1140918352300445698 2019-06-18 05:45:07 EDT <CryptosBatman> Facebook's $LIBRA coin will be a great entry for new users and help legitimize crypto, but it won't be a competitor to $BTC.  #LIBRA will be great for payments and transactions, but it's not censorship-resistant, deflationary, a store of value, or decentralized.

1140915987585179648 2019-06-18 05:35:43 EDT <AlexSaundersAU> One of the best pieces of advice I can give traders/investors:  'Ask yourself who's on the other side of the screen'  So why aren't you getting an easy entry to buy more #Bitcoin at lower prices?  Well who's selling right now on the precipice of a multi year bull market?  🤔📈🚀
1140915591345266688 2019-06-18 05:34:08 EDT <Travis_Kling> Sir when can I use my Libra on the platform to purchase Bitcoin?
1140914920705314816 2019-06-18 05:31:28 EDT <clayfromdabay> Libra will be the USD of the internet. Bitcoin is the Gold of the internet. One does not invest in USD, but nearly eight trillion dollars is invested in Gold. If Bitcoin gets the market cap of Gold, one Bitcoin will be worth $345,000. #Libra #Bitcoin @APompliano @mdudas
1140914832947994624 2019-06-18 05:31:08 EDT <CryptoCountant> Facebook's libra will bring 2.3 billion people in contact with cryptocurrency.  These are potentially 2.3 billion people that will discover $crypto like Bitcoin, or Ethereum as a better real world alternative.
1140914327094005760 2019-06-18 05:29:07 EDT <meier_bernhard> Bitcoin and Twitter will eat libra and facebook
1140914208298688512 2019-06-18 05:28:39 EDT <anondran> Dont know why so many people are mad about facebook's stablecoin Libra.   Its just another gateway for normies to enter Bitcoin and Altcoins  which is bullish af.

How long until WBTC flips the lightning network? Certainly before the end of 2019. What's your guess?  Source:   https://defipulse.com/

If only that same level of heat was directed at your central bank. Instead of asking me how I know there's a 21m cap, ask your central bank how many units of coin are on issue.

The original protocol must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of the original protocol is...oh wait, there is no history. It just stays the same. So there's no need for trust.

A weak pump on this news is imo a good litmus test on what to expect on alts. I'll short the $ltc pop as it nears halving. I think it'll disappoint.

1140721003376648194 2019-06-17 16:40:55 EDT <tokenstate> Being a Bitcoin critic doesn't make me a hater. I love all the Crypto space. Just very disappointed at the same time in BTC specifically.  Stagnation, years of Blocksize wars, & yet after 10 yrs it's worse to use than before.  The community thinks it's perfect as is. I disagree.

I’m mostly BTC
1140707925683363840 2019-06-17 15:48:57 EDT <acatspit1> Practically nobody that I know knows $BTC #Bitcoin is at ~$9300. Everyone still thinks it's going to zero or at all time lows.  This makes me believe there is no new blood entering, just old money adding to their stacks  They'll all buy over $20K at new ATH's.  Pump it 🚀 #Crypto

Doesn't feel like a good idea to be heavily exposed to alts right now. Sometimes, it's best to just sit in Bitcoin or Tether and let the market play out a little.  https://twitter.com/LomahCrypto/status/1139970947157389312 …

Until Bitcoin surpasses $20k, most retail think it's headed to zero.

1140684460368814083 2019-06-17 14:15:42 EDT <Fullbeerbottle> In 2017, everyone I talked to IRL knew that #Bitcoin was almost $10,000 at this point.  Currently, no one knows that it's almost $10,000. They've completely forgotten about it. Probably heard about it when it dropped below $5k and that's it.

1140673684832579584 2019-06-17 13:32:53 EDT <jackdanger> Bitcoin is like your cousin waking you up by shouting "Slug bug!" and punching you in the arm when they see a VW Beetle. It's a person starting a game without your consent and then winning it before you get a chance to participate. 18/

1139868062847553536 2019-06-15 08:11:38 EDT <TuurDemeester> How easy is it to create top level domain names? Yet dot com is king. Also, Bitcoin is a protocol to convert electricity into financial reliability. It's pretty much a long term winner take all outcome because of the network effects.

1139862010605256705 2019-06-15 07:47:35 EDT <hblodget> Thank you! How is Bitcoin “superior money?” Few accept it, transaction costs are high, and the value is wildly volatile.

It is no wonder the world responded in panic to create an independent digital currency.   Bitcoin is one of the clearest price Signals in the Markets for Systemic Risk.

1139710839622123520 2019-06-14 21:46:53 EDT <PeterSchiff> Seems like a bad bet for me.   If you're right and bitcoin does hit 100,000 then I owe you 1 million dollars.   But if Bitcoin is 100 dollars in 5 years, having never hit 100,000, you only owe me $500.

Data continuously shows that you need to hodl despite the ups & downs. If you sell anytime the price jumps you will make nice gains but you won’t become a millionaire.  pic.twitter.com/BS4OQm9WVK

1139699759935922177 2019-06-14 21:02:52 EDT <melikmanukyan> The euro was first introduced as an accounting currency on January 1, 1999.   It became legal tender and first started circulating as cash on January 1, 2002.  Bitcoin genesis was on Jan 3, 2009.
1139699499578695680 2019-06-14 21:01:49 EDT <econoar> What's dishonest about it?  1. "Layer 3" on bitcoin would absolutely have weaker security than ERC20s (base layer) 2. There is no infrastructure built around this idea and there is less dev infrastructure on Bitcoin vs. Ethereum overall. 3. There are no smart contracts.
1139699457451155456 2019-06-14 21:01:39 EDT <Journeyto100k_> A massive bull run is coming if the US gives the green light for crypto investing. Fidelity, Nasdaq, Bakkt and Binance US all launching very soon also. THIS is going to create more demand than EVER BEFORE  #Bitcoin #Crypto
1139698731568132096 2019-06-14 20:58:46 EDT <melikmanukyan> Fun Fact: The Euro is only 2 times older than Bitcoin.  That's how long Bitcoin has been with us.  Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.

1139675334419320832 2019-06-14 19:25:48 EDT <checksum0> Facebookcoin is a direct answer to bitcoin being unusable. You can be sure it will be super usable and user friendly, just like those Chinese payment platforms everyone uses.  Bitcoin is losing, to fiat, per its own fault.

1139669779034324992 2019-06-14 19:03:44 EDT <VitalikButerin> My argument has always been that if monetary convergence forces are strong enough to keep bitcoin in the lead vs newer and more scalable/flexible cryptocurrencies then bitcoin has no chance to unseat the almighty network effect of the US dollar.

1139616916819943424 2019-06-14 15:33:40 EDT <Bitcoin> BTC2 is a token on the #BitcoinCash blockchain (using SLP tech) that is 1:1 backed by on-chain BTC.   BTC2 is like USDT. As USDT is an IOU for USD where Tether holds the actual USD in their bank, @sideshiftai is the custodian of the on-chain BTC and issues BTC2 tokens in return. pic.twitter.com/M546mmo25B
1139615103769145345 2019-06-14 15:26:28 EDT <real_vijay> The market is up well over 100% and #Bitcoin seems expensive. You hold off buying more because, well, why buy after such a big run up?  The year is 2015. You spurned Bitcoin at $450 and missed one of the biggest bull markets in history. Oof.  🤔🚀😭
1139615004028633089 2019-06-14 15:26:04 EDT <Bitcoin> There’s a new Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) based token called BTC2 that’s backed 1:1 with BTC. With BTC2, you can essentially transact BTC, but with the same network fee (less than a penny) as bitcoin cash transactions.

1139600903625990145 2019-06-14 14:30:02 EDT <StopAndDecrypt> Let's be very clear here: "Bitcoin" isn't trying to become any of this. *Someone* is working on a project that leverages the Bitcoin protocol.
1139598550591873024 2019-06-14 14:20:41 EDT <Outsideness> Chill. It's not difficult. Every time repulsive insane shit happens just buy more Bitcoin. Your kids will thank you.

1139592193163898885 2019-06-14 13:55:26 EDT <notsofast> I feel like I need to go out and pass the bar in order to believe that $crypto regulation will be a net good, as opposed to a net evil overreach that eventually corrupts and swallows #Bitcoin.

1139564581334986756 2019-06-14 12:05:42 EDT <MishGEA> The key takeaway is how easy it is to create cryptos. There are already thousands of them. The notion of scarcity is silly.   Bitcoin has nothing going for it other than first mover advantage. That is what the best is on. Reality is that it is nothing but a copyable algorithm.

1139546324314075136 2019-06-14 10:53:10 EDT <j3todaro> Bitcoin is a permissionless, censorship resistant global currency that is not controlled by any entity.   If you cannot differentiate bitcoin's value proposition from that of libra we will have to go back to the basics.

1139544263933530112 2019-06-14 10:44:58 EDT <nlw> Every time I dip my brain into a monoculture where everyone agrees, I'm reminded why I like divisive crypto/Bitcoin Twitter (which even wants to debate what it's called) so much. We learn much more when we're around people we don't always agree with.   Shine on, debaters!
1139544231972888578 2019-06-14 10:44:51 EDT <Ether0x> Peter, this is an enormous misunderstanding that will age poorly.  Facebook's crypto is a stablecoin just like any other. Stablecoins are not new. And if the dozen other stablecoins are anything to go by, they *enhance* the ecosystem to which Bitcoin is a part of.
1139543731663773697 2019-06-14 10:42:51 EDT <PeterSchiff> Facebook's new crypto currency "Libra" is bad news for Bitcoin.  Facebook will target the very market Bitcoin is counting on for growth, the unbanked in nations with high inflation.

I think the "FacebookCoin" is an attempt by big tech, banks and credit card companies to lure people away from #Bitcoin into their "better, easier, crypto", which is nothing more than a fiat coin being masqueraded as crypto.   Millions will be fooled.

1139513950545076224 2019-06-14 08:44:31 EDT <PeterSchiff> The way #Bitcoin has been trading it looks to me like it's more of a bet against #gold than it is against fiat currencies.

An easy way to freak out some people who interpret these kinds of transactions as an impending "dump".  A few hours later, a total of 18,900 are transferred out of Coinbase again in three separate transactions.   Fake.

1138887940413767681 2019-06-12 15:16:59 EDT <hasufl> Bitcoin is designed from the ground up to survive under criminalization. Of course we'd prefer it never happens. But when it happens, I bet all the design decisions that skeptics taunt as "wasteful" or "inefficient" would appear in a different light.
1138887938547343365 2019-06-12 15:16:58 EDT <hasufl> Bitcoin doesn't care about being criminalized. On some level, you could say it yearns to be criminalized. Why?

1138843057900720128 2019-06-12 12:18:38 EDT <BitcoinSV> There is no reason why exchanges should have this much power unless the only thing people are using cryptocurrencies for is to trade them.  Bitcoin is whichever coin has the most use.   Exchanges will either reflect this or die.

1138840743034929152 2019-06-12 12:09:26 EDT <matt_odell> - Yes, exchanges could block bitcoin deposits with coinjoin history.  - None have yet fortunately.  - If some do, you can bet they will block monero deposits as well.   If you want better privacy, there is no perfect solution, Monero users should know that better than most.
1138840739574669312 2019-06-12 12:09:25 EDT <matt_odell> The Monero community used to be better than this. Really a shame to see.  Frustrating trying to get people to leak less data and use bitcoin more privately while they brigade my threads with scare tactics.   Widespread coinjoin usage helps everyone, Monero users included.  pic.twitter.com/1jcS85XhWX

1138381692266172416 2019-06-11 05:45:20 EDT <wiz> No single entity controls Bitcoin, just like no single entity controls the Internet; everyone running a full node is a peer on the network, and acts in their own interests. This is why Bitcoin will win long-term over any centralized monetary systems controlled by a single entity.

1138336272534183936 2019-06-11 02:44:51 EDT <jeetsidhu_> Bitcoin maximalists are like attack dogs trained on the scent of social attacks.  Whenever they get a hint of social engineering tactics, they act to protect Bitcoin on behalf of a silent majority which maintains Bitcoin’s lobby-resistance.

Do people that don't understand the context even care? As yourself who feels bullied and what for, and then remember Bitcoin itself is permissionless.

1138251516731674625 2019-06-10 21:08:03 EDT <APompliano> There are so many finance folks that are hiding Bitcoin.  They bought some. They're holding it.   But they don't want to tell anyone.

1138217914732097537 2019-06-10 18:54:32 EDT <bquittem> 10/ Nation states underestimate Bitcoin.   This buys time for Bitcoin to get stronger + harder to kill. The hegemonic banking system is digging their own grave with shovel made of 100% pure hubris.   If only we had a ₿ackup plan 🤔
1138217913779929089 2019-06-10 18:54:32 EDT <bquittem> 9/ Bitcoin minimizes the ability to cheat.   Bitcoin doesn’t rely on trust. Think “can’t be changed” instead of trusting that a system “won’t be changed.”   Bitcoin recognizes leaders, formalized governance, and concentration of power as attack vectors waiting to be exploited.
1138217912941064193 2019-06-10 18:54:32 EDT <bquittem> 8/ Bitcoin’s privacy improvements reduce taxability.   CoinJoins and other privacy technologies will minimize the ability for governments to attack Bitcoin through predatory tax legislation.   🙏 @wasabiwallet @SamouraiWallet

1138203737334386689 2019-06-10 17:58:12 EDT <APompliano> Family offices own bitcoin. Endowments own bitcoin. Foundations own bitcoin. Governments own bitcoin. Private pensions own bitcoin. Public pensions own bitcoin.  If you don't think every institution in the world is eventually going to own bitcoin, you're fooling yourself.

1138196822759944192 2019-06-10 17:30:43 EDT <zorinaq> The median Bitcoin transaction fee increased 20× in three months ($0.10 to $2+) and yet LN handles only ~0.1% of Bitcoin's daily transaction rate. What does this mean? Bitcoin is becoming increasingly congested—again—and LN is unable to provide relief because no one is using it.  https://twitter.com/MihailoBjelic/status/1137529433139679234 …

1138187656569995266 2019-06-10 16:54:18 EDT <WhalePanda> Dear diary, today's Bitcoin Twitter drama was about t-shirts. I feel that we reached a new low. The good thing is that Bitcoin doesn't care and is still working. Wait, let me check... yes still new blocks being found. I wish more people could take a silly joke. Good night, Panda.

1138175177903280129 2019-06-10 16:04:43 EDT <WhalePanda> He compared "Toxic Maximalist", a clear joke (as you know "Bitcoin Maximalist" was actually a toxic derogatory term coined by Vitalik to attack Bitcoiners which later Bitcoiners claimed for themselves) and compared it to "White nationalist". This is the definition of hyperbole.

1138173896484675591 2019-06-10 15:59:37 EDT <ThinkingCrypto1> Remember everyone - Markets Move In Cycles - both in the micro and macro perspective. This includes #Crypto, stocks, real estate and more. #Bitcoin #XRP #Ethereum #Litecoin #HODL
1138170839210385409 2019-06-10 15:47:28 EDT <teklordz> Anything is possible in crypto. In 2017, it took only 6 weeks (starting mid Nov) for Bitcoin to rise from 8K to 20K. Imagine what can happen in 6 months :))

1138157394498850816 2019-06-10 14:54:03 EDT <ThinkingUSD> Haven't posted a bitcoin chart in a while, it's been lifeless for that past few days. Looks primed for a breakdown retest of 8450 or so.   If 8450 is cut through we could see a sweep of 8800-9k, that's where I'll be taking profit if 8,450 breaks. If we reject then short. Simple.  pic.twitter.com/XCSwEnyZUm

1138155165687656455 2019-06-10 14:45:12 EDT <WeissRatings> The Indian government is considering a new bill that would punish anyone who trades, mines, or holds #cryptocurrency with 10 years in prison.

1138153088076795904 2019-06-10 14:36:56 EDT <Y_deGaia> Bitcoin mining is an industry. Bitcoin payment processing is an industry. Bitcoin OTC is an industry.  Bitcoin itself is the hard money those industries are built upon.  https://twitter.com/nvk/status/1138152219629490176 …
1138152891397672961 2019-06-10 14:36:09 EDT <matt_odell> Not your keys, not your coins.  Please practice responsible stacking. They aren't really your sats until you withdraw them to your own wallet(s). Bitcoin held on exchanges and custodial wallets can be lost without warning. #stackingsats

1138149459974545408 2019-06-10 14:22:31 EDT <eric_lombrozo> People in industry have been lying about Bitcoin for years, trying to get people to buy fake coins or fork the network or "fire the core devs"... and you are worried about a few people wearing t-shirts?
1138149260824911875 2019-06-10 14:21:44 EDT <francispouliot_> Bitcoin adoption is driven virally by a very low amount of individuals such as meetup organizers, conference goers, podcast hosts, bloggers/writers, investor evangelists, forum admins, etc. These (toxic) people tend to be intolerant to bullshit, abhorre the notion of compromise.

1138135548542038016 2019-06-10 13:27:14 EDT <dandabek> When you buy coffee with your debit card the teller doesn't discover the total contents of your bank account.  that's why we need a privacy system in a safex bitcoin blockchain   by default someone should not be able to see your total balance. Only the amount they received.

1138132123376742400 2019-06-10 13:13:38 EDT <ljxie> Had someone ask besides leverage why anyone would take out a DAI loan by overcollateralizing crypto. Awhile back I tried to get a bank loan but they refused to acknowledge bitcoin as an asset I owned so I was refused a loan. Side note they were also derogatory the entire process.

1137792942486085632 2019-06-09 14:45:51 EDT <Y_deGaia> Bitcoin enables flexible intergenerational money management. Features like multisig and nLockTime allow for conditional spending procedures and automated inheritance of wealth.   What took multiple advisors and exorbitant fees to set up before, will soon be available to anyone.

1137784229280935936 2019-06-09 14:11:13 EDT <eric_lombrozo> Come back to Bitcoin, Roger.
1137784021960859649 2019-06-09 14:10:24 EDT <chainscience> BSV is already a more functional network than BTC.  We will fight until people understand what Bitcoin is all about. 🌐 @CalvinAyre is probably one of the smartest investors in crypto and not a lot of people seem to understand that yet.
1137783303358967808 2019-06-09 14:07:33 EDT <vinarmani> Bitcoin is fundamentally incompatible with taxation because Proof Of Work is a rejection of the notion of "The Social Contract," from which the state's justification of taxation is drawn.  "Doing Bitcoin" proves, including with actual SIGNATURES, your voluntary participation.
1137783172220018688 2019-06-09 14:07:01 EDT <CandleHater> At the #LightningHackdayMUC people waited in line to pay for a beer from @gugol's beer tap that accepts LN payments. The funny thing was, that people could get a free beer without waiting from the fridge besides.  Paying Bitcoin over #LightningNetwork is better then free beer.
1137782829650042880 2019-06-09 14:05:40 EDT <DesiCryptoHodlr> Exactly, #Bitcoin is common man's best bet to win big  Everyone thinking it's too late to buy cheap Bitcoin  Zoom out, see the big picture, 5 years from now $7000 or $8000 will not matter  The fact that you took action and bought it before 99% of the world will  Buy, HODL, Repeat

1137534210678382592 2019-06-08 21:37:44 EDT <JBTheCryptoKing> Bitcoin is going to $500,000 or $0.  If the odds are 10% we get to $500,000 one day...  Then speculatively speaking BTC should be trading at $50,000.  Bitcoin with a finite supply, potentially ever increasing demand, and a halving in 1 year is literally on the cusp of a 10x+.

1137251030775869445 2019-06-08 02:52:29 EDT <PianoXr> A main reason I’m so confident $XRP will succeed is that way before Ripple is done selling, there’ll be too many heavy-hitters with skin in the game for it to fail.  #Bitcoin showed us that even without tech (which $XRP has) things happen where the right people have $ incentive.

1137169660820873216 2019-06-07 21:29:09 EDT <woonomic> Fiat is a good SoV for HODL on monthly timeframes.  Gold and houses can act as a SoV for HODLs over many years, ideally decades or more.  Bitcoin is good SoV for HODL periods of 4 years+
1137169655536087040 2019-06-07 21:29:08 EDT <woonomic> Bitcoin’s core utility is that of a store of value. Speculation is the foundation of SoV. If you buy into an asset, you need someone to buy it off you later, hopefully at the same or higher price. You’ve stored value for a period.  https://twitter.com/ahmadosiddiqi/status/1136598156723085314 …

1137163157066080257 2019-06-07 21:03:18 EDT <bascule> I'm saying Bitcoin uses as much electricity as the entire country of New Zealand to perform a function otherwise possible on a Raspberry Pi and authenticating data at a rate deliverable over a 14.4kbps modem.  And in case that weren't clear enough: it's absurd.
1137162104836722689 2019-06-07 20:59:07 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> Those who don't believe #Bitcoin will get to $1M+ need to educate themselves. $1M BTC is no pie in the sky guess. It's based on the network effect. When Facebook only had a small number of users nobody cared but when it reached critical mass suddenly everyone wanted an account.

1137114031133790208 2019-06-07 17:48:06 EDT <bsvking> BitCoin (BSV) is neutral money. It is not designed to facilitate crime, but it is also *not* meant to facilitate govt surveillance and invasion of privacy. This is important as every coin trying to do something different is upsetting that balance and making the situation worse!
1137113862313009157 2019-06-07 17:47:25 EDT <APompliano> You’re thinking of Bitcoin like a stock. I’m thinking of it as something that eliminates the greatest cause of income inequality: inflation

1137111880953139202 2019-06-07 17:39:33 EDT <JoelKatz> Bitcoin costs millions of dollars a day to solve this problem and it gets mediocre finality and mediocre censorship resistance.

1136856146738679817 2019-06-07 00:43:21 EDT <CointractCom> With $BSV delisted from major hobby exchanges, it's decoupled from their whale trading algos. It's free to follow its own trading pattern.

1136855045872312320 2019-06-07 00:38:59 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> In 2016/17 (alt fever) many believed #Bitcoin would end up just another insignificant crypto.

1136767548639318016 2019-06-06 18:51:18 EDT <maxkeiser> Banksters know now they can’t stop #Bitcoin. What they’ll try is a bear hug. They’ll try to crowd BTC out of the market by flooding the globe with their centralized crypto. The idea is to try and marginalize BTC.  Fortunately, their own corruption will kill them.
1136766378348883969 2019-06-06 18:46:39 EDT <maxkeiser> The problem is, the SEC, although having rules against manipulating markets, DOES NOT ENFORCE, OR SELECTIVELY ENFORCES THE RULES.   We have proven this to be true dozens of times on @KeiserReport #Bitcoin gets rid of the corrupt SEC  via its self-regulating protocol.  https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1136609329853947904 …

1136764165677297664 2019-06-06 18:37:51 EDT <maxkeiser> Nope.

LTC has a consensus algo too. The consensus mechanism is nothing to do with it being a blockchain or not. Please try to understand what you are doing

1136493135272579073 2019-06-06 00:40:53 EDT <giacomozucco> This "transparent Bitcoin" narrative is retarded beyond belief. "Hard" money simply CANNOT work if it's not "dark" money as well. If the state wants to tax via inflation, it will ban "hard" alternative, just as w/ physical gold & e-gold. Bitcoin can be "hard" because it's "dark".

1136483736923623424 2019-06-06 00:03:32 EDT <ChrisPacia> I would also say the most likely reason Bitcoin doesn't have stronger anonymity isn't because Satoshi wanted to help law enforcement and governments, but because solving one problem (preventing double spends in a decentralized network) was hard enough on its own.

1136328988731691008 2019-06-05 13:48:37 EDT <SarahJamieLewis> Hey @vanmayorsoffice - I run @OpenPriv a nonprofit research group based in Vancouver that works with marginalized communities, and would be happy to sit down with someone to explain why this whole charade against Bitcoin ATMs is misguided.
1136327877660741632 2019-06-05 13:44:12 EDT <Bitcoin_Beyond> The BTC & BCH camps have to explain why imposing external restrictions on the mining market is a good thing.  A basic understanding of economics helps you understand that this is never a good thing.  Bitcoin (SV) is an inevitability because it is unrestricted by central planners.

1136324662990909441 2019-06-05 13:31:26 EDT <_unwriter> The goal for Bitbus is to become a SECURE and TRUSTWORTHY Bitcoin full node alternative for app developers.

1136324661472616449 2019-06-05 13:31:25 EDT <_unwriter> The problem with Planaria is,  the moment you decide to run your own Planaria node you run into all the infrastructure problems mentioned above. You need to operate a Bitcoin full node and whole infrastructure to support it.   This is where Bitbus comes in.

When investors are taking risk off, they are likely to sell Bitcoin.  But when they are putting risk back on, they are just as likely to keep selling Bitcoin.

1135893932297129984 2019-06-04 08:59:52 EDT <JWilliamsFstmed> If Bitcoin has the potential to replace the TAM of global currency (~100T) or more, why would you sell Bitcoin now?  The hardest thing to do is to do nothing with your Bitcoin other than secure it.

1135883769435566082 2019-06-04 08:19:28 EDT <rektcapital> Whenever #Bitcoin is on the cusp of a strong move, just reduce your Altcoin exposure and stay in $BTC (or stablecoin)  Even if you jump the gun and reduce Altcoin exposure too soon, sure you'll miss out on an opportunity or two  But at least you managed your risk responsibly

1135879943336865792 2019-06-04 08:04:16 EDT <C3_Nik> I mentioned this before but it is worth to be brought up again:  Most people missed the rise up to 8800$ in #Bitcoin #BTC. Every single person who did has an incentive now to say: "It will drop to 6k, 4k or even 1.5k". That is important to keep in mind. A lot of biases out there.

1135804625544765441 2019-06-04 03:04:59 EDT <oudekaas3> Bitcoin is not a software project.... it is a system!  Bitcoin exists of three major elements in this specific order.

1135803601270521856 2019-06-04 03:00:55 EDT <CryptoMichNL> Honestly I’m really excited about alts/BTC pairs holding here.   Or am I the only one?   #BITCOIN $BTC
1135801802970894336 2019-06-04 02:53:46 EDT <nwoodfine> .@MartyBent suggested “Buy Bitcoin,” but I’d go with “Hodl” as being the simpler and more ignored advice. Both are equally right.  https://twitter.com/sama/status/1135575832942874624 …
1135801485105803264 2019-06-04 02:52:30 EDT <Beautyon_> Who Satoshi is or was doesn't matter, and cannot matter, because what he created is an abstract set of written instructions that a machine or a human can follow. If you can't understand this, you are the one with the problem, not Bitcoin!
1135800787240660992 2019-06-04 02:49:44 EDT <teddycleps> All I want is for the #bitcoin dominance to drop below 50% ⚔️🔥  pic.twitter.com/u0k8o03oKi
1135800410533314560 2019-06-04 02:48:14 EDT <real_vijay> 13/ In the coming hype cycle, the people most ready to increase their allocation to #Bitcoin are those who were already curious about it and perhaps had made a small allocation to it in the prior cycle. They are ready to be activated in the next bull run and will define its size
1135800405483372544 2019-06-04 02:48:13 EDT <real_vijay> 11/ However, for those who are ideologically *opposed* to #Bitcoin there is no number of touchpoints that will convince them of its importance. Think of people like @paulkrugman or @Nouriel. They will be walking around with wheelbarrows of worthless fiat before owning bitcoins.
1135800123928252419 2019-06-04 02:47:06 EDT <Beautyon_> I can never get over just how poor quality the thinking of some people are. Who Satoshi is literally means nothing and is totally separate from how Bitcoin works. Statements like the one below are part of the problem that will never go away, because people who can't think won't.  pic.twitter.com/Rx2inUIpVT

1135796676231176193 2019-06-04 02:33:24 EDT <jb55> miniscript is a game changer for bitcoin smart contracts. It could be used as a standard way to provide signatures without having a special app or program for every specific situation. It reduces the risk of writing scripts that don't work, and makes them easier to analyze. cool!
1135793668629995520 2019-06-04 02:21:27 EDT <JimmyWinMedia> P.S.  I recommend any contributors to #BCH developer funding ask how much of their donations will go to fund that pricey Silicon Valley operation  that Bitcoin ABC asked nChain and CoinGeek to fund last year but wes not a worthwhile use of money.
1135790484813635584 2019-06-04 02:08:48 EDT <JimmyWinMedia> The infrastructure for a global money system cannot depend on crowdfunding donations.  It’s time for #Bitcoin to grow up and professionalize.  One of the many reasons for #BitcoinSV #BSV

1135693554393575424 2019-06-03 19:43:38 EDT <justicemate> This is the model Dr Wright refers to with Bitcoin at scale. When miners only make fees from transactions, hashing becomes a sawtooth function. As transactions build in the mempool, more miners join to find the block, generating more hash, until the block is found.  pic.twitter.com/foJqOSUYr9

There are plenty of reasons to have a global currency like Bitcoin. Not so much for most people to have global social networking.

1135598521271250944 2019-06-03 13:26:00 EDT <eric_lombrozo> Bitcoin doesn't care whether you get easily offended or not. It doesn't care if you are pro-this or anti-that. It doesn't care whether you like developers, media companies, corporate culture, or the State.  It just makes sure you can have control over your own money if you want.

1135125398562492416 2019-06-02 06:05:59 EDT <cryptokatia> The narrative of Bitcoin’s purpose changed drastically since 2008. Greed, stubbornness, covert ops, lack of communication brought us to almost nowhere in terms of adoption. Disagree with me, but in 2008-2010 what people cared about is having a working wallet for p2p transactions.

1134868731631460352 2019-06-01 13:06:05 EDT <brucefenton> Bitcoin is a digital asset & form of money. The supply is limited & written into the open source code.  Peers, not a central authority, verify what is true on the ledger. This is done by nodes & mining blocks every 10 minutes. This is also the issuance & governance method.
1134868030750638080 2019-06-01 13:03:18 EDT <Rhythmtrader> US dollar has lost 99.99% of its value against Bitcoin.  Only hold as many dollars as you are willing to lose.
1134867474329980928 2019-06-01 13:01:05 EDT <crypt0snews> Bitcoin is open, immutable, borderless, censorship-resistant, and immune to governments & central banks...  For everything else, there's Mastercard.

However, odds are its succesor is not bitcoin, but rather tech giants such as Google and Facebook. Alibaba already has the largest money market in the world, while in China Wechat Pay has replaced cash.

1134856070940188672 2019-06-01 12:15:46 EDT <vinarmani> Tone is a mess. 🤦  Yes, moving millions of dollars in value for $5 is great.

1134690476957753345 2019-06-01 01:17:45 EDT <BCHcain> Today I tried to talk to someone about Bitcoin. They had no interest in it. Immediately referred to it as "a way to lose your money".  The only possible way someone like that will be convinced is if they start seeing other people using it. That won't happen if all you do is hodl.
1134684811531038720 2019-06-01 00:55:15 EDT <XrpCenter> In case this isn't sufficient to convince you about Bitcoin's indoctrinated false reality, remember that the most significant part of its trading volume derives from USDT pairs, a "stablecoin" that has been, admittedly, collateralized with Bitcoin itself.   https://twitter.com/XrpCenter/status/1130906761517387776?s=19 …
1134681959173505025 2019-06-01 00:43:55 EDT <XrpCenter> In 2019, a terrifying 89.7% of all bitcoin transactions have been associated with exchanges' activities (i.e. not used for payment/transfer use-cases).  Bitwise says that 95% of exchanges' trading volume is fake (i.e. wash trading).  Bitcoin is an induced optical illusion.  https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1134268420000817153 …

I’ve used BSV so much in the last 6 months far more than anything else before it may magnitudes over.   $BSV is #bitcoin #CraigisSatoshi https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1134268420000817153 …

1134675287780675585 2019-06-01 00:17:24 EDT <NotSkycoinCEO> Skycoin has 30% more nodes on its network than Bitcoin, so the Skycoin price should be 30% higher than Bitcoin. #networkEffects
