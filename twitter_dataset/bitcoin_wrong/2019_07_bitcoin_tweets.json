1151185372761722882 2019-07-16 13:42:35 EDT <apriljpollock> This is our weekly $BTC chart currently.  Our wick bounced right off of the EMA and we do have quite a bit of support at this level... but it is possible that we wick further down. In my opinion getting #bitcoin under 10k is a steal in the long-term game.  pic.twitter.com/IbQRNLnrQD

Lot's more regulations are coming related to crypto currencies that will drive up the cost of speculating in them.  Crypto speculators are underestimating this risk!

1150850578920169478 2019-07-15 15:32:14 EDT <gaborgurbacs> Agreed. I thought Treasury Secretary Mnuchin had a fair and balanced view on Bitcoin and digital assets. Mnuchin told the general public to play by the rules, don’t do anything illegal and there are paths forwards. That’s my cautiously optimistic take.  https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1150832379625398272 …

1150840435612499968 2019-07-15 14:51:56 EDT <AdamParkhomenko> Mnuchin’s response is basically the twitter bio of most MAGA trash. Trump’s not a racist; Bitcoin is the future.  https://twitter.com/seungminkim/status/1150832512484225026 …
1150839179649138688 2019-07-15 14:46:56 EDT <mrilirgashi> The US government is trying to scare people about Bitcoin.  This means only one thing.  The collapse of fiat currencies is closer than expected.
1150838571823247360 2019-07-15 14:44:31 EDT <maxkeiser> The first day #Bitcoin ignored today’s US Treasury Secretary’s remarks was Jan. 3, 2009. Anything any govt official might say; any action they might take was rendered DOA on that day. For some, this was obvious, and they started HODL’ing. For many more, the day to HODL is today.
1150838433268547584 2019-07-15 14:43:58 EDT <alistairmilne> US Treasury Secretary:  - HODL'ing Bitcoin is fine - Using it for illegal stuff is not
1150837922846973953 2019-07-15 14:41:56 EDT <Rhythmtrader> The Chairman of the Federal Reserve and Secretary of the Treasury, see Bitcoin as a store of value, like gold.   Meanwhile, the President feels threatened by both Libra and Bitcoin.  Short of adopting bitcoin as a national currency, how much more bullish could this honestly be?
1150837822259113984 2019-07-15 14:41:33 EDT <APompliano> UPDATE: The US government likes Bitcoin as long as you don't break the law!
1150835851154350080 2019-07-15 14:33:43 EDT <fundstrat> Bitcoin seems comfortable with statements made by #Mnuchin regarding Crypto and KYC/AML.   - White House wants fair ground rules but does not seem intent on further action at this time.   - $BTC rise shows market comfortable with this  Cc: ⁦@stevenmnuchin1⁩ pic.twitter.com/muHV1RFoxK
1150835737706807298 2019-07-15 14:33:16 EDT <Travis_Kling> The Chairman of the Fed and the Treasury Security both agree that Bitcoin is a speculative store of value.   Both of them, along with the President, agree that Libra and Bitcoin are two very different things.   Wildly bullish.
1150835695591788544 2019-07-15 14:33:05 EDT <krugermacro> Mnuchin issued a warning to those not complying with US AML laws. No talk of a ban. Said specifically that bitcoin speculation is OK.  Based on the weekend's sell-off, seems key players knew in advance about this press conference, and sold into it. Seeing short covering now.
1150835655662014470 2019-07-15 14:32:56 EDT <mdotbit> The US President, the Fed Chairman, and the US Treasury Sec have all commented on Bitcoin in the past week.
1150834995986096130 2019-07-15 14:30:19 EDT <JamesTodaroMD> The US president, multiple members of congress, and now Secretary Mnuchin have stated that the US wants to preserve USD as the global reserve instead of any crypto including bitcoin.  Any country or gov’t that wants the upside of becoming a world power should be buying bitcoin.
1150833839411027971 2019-07-15 14:25:43 EDT <Rhythmtrader> They warn that bitcoin is used by criminals, but it's actually our best tool against them.  Bank fines, last 20 years:  Bank of America: $58B JPMorgan:  $29B Citigroup:  $17B Wells Fargo:  $14B Deutsche Bank:  $12B Goldman Sachs:  $9B  Buy bitcoin, bye banks. 🔥
1150833810382213120 2019-07-15 14:25:36 EDT <EmeraldRobinson> Looks like Facebook's LIBRA bitcoin venture will not be launching soon after all. The Trump Administration just halted that idea today.
1150833703322562562 2019-07-15 14:25:10 EDT <Rhythmtrader> Fiat  is "designed" to addict you to spending.  Bitcoin is "designed" to addict you to  saving.

1150833030124199937 2019-07-15 14:22:30 EDT <APompliano> The Treasury Secretary is currently touting the “artwork” and “design” of the US dollar as security features.  Bitcoin is secured by state-of-the-art cryptography.  I’ll take the math over the art! 🙏🏽

1150832556453109762 2019-07-15 14:20:37 EDT <CharlieShrem> This is so bullish right now, I wish I could explain it in a non Rated X way. #Bitcoin
1150832354400841728 2019-07-15 14:19:49 EDT <paulvigna> Mnuchin says he has no idea why bitcoin's trading where it is - putting him in a bucket comprising 99.9% of everybody else.
1150832041346371589 2019-07-15 14:18:34 EDT <MatiGreenspan> Bitcoin trading on Wall Street is still on the table.  Mnuchin confirms, bitcoin speculation is OK, they're want to target the "illicit" use of crypto.
1150831786055876608 2019-07-15 14:17:33 EDT <jerrybrito> OK, he said nothing new affecting Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies. No change in policy. His prepared statement drew the appropriate distinction between decentralized and centralized networks. 😅

1150831015113494528 2019-07-15 14:14:30 EDT <Melt_Dem> Mnuchin just said investors should do their own research and be careful when buying bitcoin  measured and fair, in my opinion. very impressed by the level of nuance here.
1150830933269835776 2019-07-15 14:14:10 EDT <SarahJamieLewis> A sitting US president tweeting about Bitcoin followed by a surprise press conference highlighting the "national security" issue of cryptocurrencies.  The fear is palpable.

1150829979632132096 2019-07-15 14:10:23 EDT <APompliano> Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin basically told everyone to follow the rules and not doing illegal things with Bitcoin or crypto.  Sounds like a green light for those who want to do things the right way 🙏🏽
1150829635107790848 2019-07-15 14:09:01 EDT <bitstein> Mnuchin is right that Bitcoin is a national security issue. The United States must adopt Bitcoin if it wishes to protect itself from ruin via its extremely fragile fiat hegemony.  https://twitter.com/bitstein/status/1126654439690047493 …

1150829267833491464 2019-07-15 14:07:33 EDT <APompliano> Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says that Bitcoin is based on thin air.  Someone better tell him how fiat currencies work...
1150827500202856449 2019-07-15 14:00:32 EDT <crypto_rand> It's amazing how some guys from USA think that every single politician/event from there can destroy/moon #Bitcoin.  Wake up, #Bitcoin is bigger than your country. It's a worlwide movement with  a ton of different players/countries involved.
1150827215187259392 2019-07-15 13:59:24 EDT <bitstein> If Mnuchin cares about the United States, he'll announce the adoption of the Bitcoin standard as soon as possible.
1150826129651109888 2019-07-15 13:55:05 EDT <crypto_rand> Maybe one day you guys from USA will understand that Bitcoin is bigger than your country and your regulations :)

1150750251483054081 2019-07-15 08:53:34 EDT <CharlieShrem> Good intentions are not transferrable  While one leaders intentions may be good, the power and precedence he or she creates is bad.   This is why in #Bitcoin, there is no one party with power over another. Its not that we have bad intentions now, we want to protect our future.

1150745931022786560 2019-07-15 08:36:24 EDT <thibm_> We haven’t had actual money for the last 50 years.   Money, before anything, is a store of value. It must be scarce and limited in supply for people to save in it.  Fiat is only a payment rail that we use to exchange value. No one stores wealth in fiat.  Bitcoin is changing that.

1150689947306921984 2019-07-15 04:53:56 EDT <Heavidor> The rise of nationalism, racism, inequality, poverty and bitcoin can all be traced to the financial collapse of 2007; governments bailed out the powerful and imposed ongoing austerity on the poor. Nationalism moves the problem around and blames your neighbour. Economics cures it.  https://twitter.com/SimonPia1/status/1150678357685788673 …

No person or superpower can stop Bitcoin. But weak hands needs to be shaken on a regular basis.  Only education prevents weak hands.

1150518209746857984 2019-07-14 17:31:31 EDT <BryceWeiner> Bitcoin is the greatest live action puzzle game ever created: solve the problems within the context of the world in which it exists without destroying it in the process.   If you win you get to change the world.
1150516943524368386 2019-07-14 17:26:29 EDT <YORK780> Bitcoin:   - transparent - immutable - decentralized - hardcap - deflationary - both for retail and institutions - 24/7 development and expanding - 24/7 working worldwide - store of value  Dollar:   - coloured paper with emoji’s on it - vunerable - infinite - centralized - 💩
1150516357693353984 2019-07-14 17:24:09 EDT <NeerajKA> I like when someone famous posts that they don’t know what bitcoin is and people with respond with “it’s like xyz coin without the smart contracts and scaling” (or whatever) as if they are going to know what that means
1150515675355635716 2019-07-14 17:21:27 EDT <mir_btc> If somebody can now understand Bitcoin with a mild research is bc some people put a lot of effort in creating resources & educating.  The situation was very different some years ago. Also, it really depends: deeper levels can require a lifetime only to be nearly grasped.  https://twitter.com/FunnyRosie/status/1150202124174671872 …

1150406254793285632 2019-07-14 10:06:39 EDT <RyanSAdams> Fiat on-ramps can never be crypto native so ETH & BTC have equal capability on that measure  But once crypto native, Bitcoin can't have an unstoppable banking layer  Ethereum can  This makes it a more unstoppable money system

1150398762633846785 2019-07-14 09:36:53 EDT <Rhythmtrader> Federal Reserve, "Bitcoin is a speculative store of value, just like gold."  As a reminder, once bitcoin overtakes gold, each bitcoin will be worth over $350,000.   We live in the digital age, a digital store-of-value is the future.  Now even central banks agree.

1150397780747325440 2019-07-14 09:32:58 EDT <coinyeezy> That’s because they want you to be confused. It’s in the “experts” favor to confuse you. They want to use you.  Bitcoin is actually really simple. The only thing you need to read is:  http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf   Read it as many times as you need. You don’t need any “expert” advice.
1150397265934192641 2019-07-14 09:30:56 EDT <BullyEsq> Here’s a hot take - debit card transactions are currently far more private than bitcoin transactions.  There’s a searchable public ledger of all bitcoin transactions!  Privacy coins seem to be the only way to digitally replicate cash’s properties.

Shut down crypto banks & centralized exchanges. Kill liquidity  To have an unstoppable money you need an unstoppable banking layer  Ethereum will have both

1150321819657916417 2019-07-14 04:31:08 EDT <wintercooled> 5/ Perhaps "Bitcoin is digital real estate" is a stretched analogy, but Bitcoin really is far more accessible and understandable to the young, who have been priced out of the actual real estate market and will be looking for a way to secure their future wealth.
1150321818458345472 2019-07-14 04:31:08 EDT <wintercooled> 4/ Bitcoin as digital gold is a great analogy but unfortunately the wider public don't understand why gold is valuable in the first place. Many more think they know why real estate is: competition to buy limited resources drives up price.
1150321816101163008 2019-07-14 04:31:07 EDT <wintercooled> 2/ Real estate supply is limited by habitable landmass. Bitcoin supply is limited by software. Unlike real estate, you can buy fractions of the digital "real estate" and transfer it globally for pennies. There's no permission required to buy in and it's a market open to everyone.

1150248283845140480 2019-07-13 23:38:56 EDT <VentureCoinist> $BTC has been chopping around the middle of this range for 2 days now.   The volume that came in the last 4hr candle hints at upside. I use volume spikes as a possible inflection point in short term trends.   Compare to the last time Bitcoin found local low on a push down.  pic.twitter.com/YoYWhgZQBV

1150244370706325504 2019-07-13 23:23:23 EDT <l3l2ucelee> This is exactly how Bitcoin creeps to $20,000 with retail investors never getting in... they adamantly watch the price for days or weeks as it goes up but then see a correction & prices decrease by 20-30% and either get scared or lose interest. They're waiting to buy the top.

1150140699859288064 2019-07-13 16:31:26 EDT <TrustlessState> Literally the opposite.   People say "Bitcoin" when they should really be saying "Crypto"  The only way Bitcoin captures everything that's going on in crypto is through the false narratives about what Bitcoin is.   Bitcoin is just Bitcoin. Everything is is "crypto"  https://twitter.com/pedromvpg/status/1150058769436545024 …

1150131814016737280 2019-07-13 15:56:07 EDT <pierre_rochard> The marketing of any altcoin has to begin with anti-bitcoin arguments. For those arguments to be persuasive, they have to lie (by omission or explicitly) about the tradeoffs that their altcoin has versus bitcoin's tradeoffs. When the lies are debunked, altcoiners have to cry foul

At $11,200, this is still true. The rich (mostly) hate BTC because they want the poor to stay poor. Do you want to stay poor?

1150002022785179650 2019-07-13 07:20:22 EDT <NoahPierau> Personally I define Bitcoin as an idea (sound money), and BTC as one of its many iterations. In this view, Litecoin, Monero or Decred never "left" Bitcoin, they are merely exploring alternative implementations. Every person has a choice which project is the real Bitcoin to them.

1149889885827993600 2019-07-12 23:54:47 EDT <DeaterBob> Bitcoin is a $200BB honey pot and potentially the biggest threat to the status quo ever to exist.  Its being attacked in every way possible 24/7/365  If an exploitable weakness existed it would be exploited instantly and w/o delay.  The last hurdle is surviving the halvings.
1149889013341310978 2019-07-12 23:51:19 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> I think Trump made it very clear yesterday that the USD is under threat from #Bitcoin. Don't be fooled. This was nothing but a thinly veiled threat and a desperate attempt to avoid the inevitable. The sooner we all adopt BTC the sooner we will reclaim our freedom.  pic.twitter.com/MdDQxyozMX

The argument that bitcoin is bad because criminals use it isn't a serious one.

Trump and Fed chair Powell just said, ‘#Bitcoin is as good as Gold’ A Gold standard is tough to implement, but taking BTC to $100k is easy.
1149664167504121862 2019-07-12 08:57:51 EDT <twobitidiot> The Fed could snap up 25% of the bitcoin supply, and end up in a win-win situation at essentially no cost.   Money is free to print (MMT!), so if bitcoin tanks, no biggie.  If the USD hyperinflates, they still own their pro rata of a global reserve (based on GDP).   Just saying.

1149658993159098368 2019-07-12 08:37:18 EDT <PeterSchiff> When Powell said people were buying Bitcoin as a speculative store of value like gold, he was not agreeing that Bitcoin is a store of value, or that it's in any way similar to gold.  He was simply opining on what Bitcoin buyers believe. He's right.  The Bitcoin buyers are wrong!

1149584492559863808 2019-07-12 03:41:15 EDT <wiz> According to the @goxdox leak website run by an anonymous person or group, the Japanese exchange @BITPointJP that was today announced it was hacked for 3.5B JPY was trusted by Mt.

1149580487809044480 2019-07-12 03:25:21 EDT <MatiGreenspan> He's basically just highlighted to the entire word the exact thought process that makes Libra bullish for Bitcoin.  Namely... Bitcoin is decentralized and can't be shut down. Doesn't matter if the President likes it or not. Unlike Libra, there's nothing he can do to stop it.
1149580077572616192 2019-07-12 03:23:43 EDT <aedison> There are guys who sincerely believe their replies to the President can convince him that Bitcoin will save America, which is only wrong in that: the President doesn’t care about America; he’s not reading replies; those replies are unconvincing; Bitcoin is a pump-and-dump scam.

1149578834271883266 2019-07-12 03:18:46 EDT <adam3us> Bitcoin is the free market pulling society back from the cliff of dystopian geopolitical failure, by separating money from State. Via dilluting the dystopian economic influence of State power. It's a free market decentralised counter-veiling opt-out force.

1149575395529781252 2019-07-12 03:05:07 EDT <zhusu> There's this myth that you could've been lucky and bought Bitcoin in 2012-13 and be up 100x+ now.  Actually you'd have sold at 5x or more likely 0.5x b/c you don't know why you put money in in the first place.  Investing is belief and thesis, not luck.

1149564337138180096 2019-07-12 02:21:10 EDT <Crypto_Bitlord> The president of the United States of America (Donald Pump) has tweeted about #Bitcoin and #Crypto !

1149562805269323776 2019-07-12 02:15:05 EDT <FatihSK87> Relax. Trump says he's not a 'fan' of Bitcoin. He doesn't have to be.   He's sending a clear message to Libra.
1149562285913829376 2019-07-12 02:13:01 EDT <themooncarl> I am not a fan of the US dollar and other fiat currencies, whose value are devalued time and time again by governments, and even by private banks through credit expansion. The US dollar has lost 98% of its value since 1913.  #Bitcoin can’t be printed.   Buy Bitcoin!!

1149533123882864640 2019-07-12 00:17:08 EDT <haydentiff> I took it as someone who just learned what Bitcoin is really used for wanting a turn to advertise it as a tool for “unlawful behavior.” I also imagined him giggling like a school girl as he typed.
1149530368988471297 2019-07-12 00:06:11 EDT <digitsu> That's why BitCoin (BSV) is focusing on providing an actual utility to the network, so that it is not based on thin air. That value is storing, indexing and valuing data on the internet. The other Bitcoin derivative projects (BTC, BCH) are as you say, based on nothing. A ponzi.

1149530150674939904 2019-07-12 00:05:19 EDT <peterktodd> +1  I find it quite plausible that Trump is talking about Bitcoin because of Libra - knows little about both - and hates both because Facebook is not a friend to conservatives.  https://twitter.com/kmbecker13/status/1149523174226157568 …

1149529225008803842 2019-07-12 00:01:39 EDT <TheBitcoinPope> Trump literally was trying to devalue the dollar...so...either he hates the dollars, hates the freedom of bitcoin, loves the banks, or doesn’t understand any of this at all
1149529105555046401 2019-07-12 00:01:10 EDT <DigiByteUN> The DigiByte Unlimited Network does not agree with these tweets by President of United States 🇺🇸.

1149527434330398720 2019-07-11 23:54:32 EDT <onebigorangecom> Trump's arguments against Bitcoin saying it's used for drug trade applies more to the US dollar. I bet 99.99% of drug trade is in USD 😂
1149526902618505217 2019-07-11 23:52:25 EDT <WIRED> President Trump unleashed a three-tweet squall Thursday night declaring himself “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies,” and referring to the use of “unregu­lated digital assets” for “drug trade and other illegal activities.”  https://wired.trib.al/GMQc3ZH

1149525856357736449 2019-07-11 23:48:15 EDT <TraceMayer> What do you think about @realDonaldTrump politicizing @federalreserve, monetary policy, #Bitcoin, etc.?  Estimated 10m+ US #Bitcoin owners. Satoshi chose a *4* year halvening cycle. Next halving halfway into 2020 election cycle. $BTC price could go crazy; then flips for votes? 🧐
1149524924156899334 2019-07-11 23:44:33 EDT <MarkYusko> #DearPOTUS  Money is a medium of exchange for goods or services within an economy  Therefore #Bitcoin is Money  Some money is fiat, meaning it has no intrinsic value. That is, paper or metal used to create it is not worth much in terms of its value as a raw material.  That is USD
1149524914598100992 2019-07-11 23:44:31 EDT <billbarhydt> Being a successful tech entrepreneur is about establishing product/market fit for a product no one knew they wanted when you started your company.  You go from contrarian to master of the obvious in 10 short years.  #bitcoin

1149524226560290816 2019-07-11 23:41:47 EDT <naomibrockwell> Trump tweeted earlier this evening about Bitcoin, saying he's "Not A Fan".

1149515887814164487 2019-07-11 23:08:39 EDT <BTC_Macro> Trump tweets that Bitcoin is a scam.  Bitcoin doesn’t give a fuck and continues to go sideways.  Bullish!
1149515558523531264 2019-07-11 23:07:20 EDT <PeterSchiff> Except there is no new metal that can replace gold.  But there is an infinite number of crypto currencies that can replace Bitcoin.

1149514979554422789 2019-07-11 23:05:02 EDT <stephanlivera> Instead of @PeterSchiff expecting us to teach him why Bitcoin is needed, why doesn't he explain to us why gold won't fall victim to govt co-opting?   Simply put, gold is too politically vulnerable.

1149510516362006528 2019-07-11 22:47:18 EDT <GabeHoff> Econ 101  Bitcoin = NOT a scam  NOT an "investment", or a "currency"  Currency = universally accepted medium of exchange in a nation, with a relatively stable value  Investment = owning a claim on underlying real asset  Btc = medium of exchange, accepted by certain parties

I'd love to invite you to have lunch with crypto leaders along with @WarrenBuffett on July 25. I guarantee you after this lunch, nobody will know crypto more than you!
1149508137440780296 2019-07-11 22:37:51 EDT <MarkYusko> #DearPOTUS  You say #Bitcoin’s value is based on air, could you answer few questions for me?  Can I surrender my USD to govt for gold or silver?  Can I surrender my USD to govt for share of tax revenue?  Who sets value of USD?   Hasn’t USD lost 95% of purchasing power since 1913?

1149503150354657284 2019-07-11 22:18:02 EDT <jillruthcarlson> There is no final boss for bitcoin.  As with freedom, we will have to be vigilant in its preservation. We must constantly fight for it and defend it. We must be the watchmen in the walls.

1149500658862575616 2019-07-11 22:08:08 EDT <StopAndDecrypt> If you have any money in Bitcoin at all, chances are you aren't going to sell just because Trump tweeted about it.  If the price goes down it's because "big money" pulled out.  Take their Bitcoin. Buy any and all dips.
1149500385091964929 2019-07-11 22:07:03 EDT <LukeDashjr> The US Dollar is based on thin air... Bitcoin is based on math.  All money will get illicit usage, but so far, the currency of choice for unlawful behaviour is the US Dollar, not Bitcoin.
1149499989447471105 2019-07-11 22:05:28 EDT <Altcoinbuzzio> Today, possibly one of the BIGGEST twitter accounts posted about #Bitcoin.  61.9 Million Followers!  Bakkt, likely launching on 22nd July!  Bitcoin halving in 295 days!  Bullish is noisy, bearish is quiet.  What do you hear?
1149498210714472451 2019-07-11 21:58:24 EDT <fundstrat> First reaction-disappointed White House weighing in on Bitcoin without much in the way of two-way hearings.  On other hand, should any other policy stance be expected given the importance of USD dominance?  Probably exactly the reason and rationale  for early adopters of $BTC
1149497369739706368 2019-07-11 21:55:04 EDT <TheDukeWilder> Of course you're not a fan. You can't control it.   Let me tell you this...

1149495977180459010 2019-07-11 21:49:32 EDT <johnkim77> No government  No president  No country  Can stop Bitcoin & Litecoin.   But they "can" stop Facebook's libra.  This is the power of decentralization!
1149495967135105025 2019-07-11 21:49:29 EDT <ErikVoorhees> Trump tweets... BTC does nothing. Bitcoin is now less volatile than Donald Trump.

1149495611067994112 2019-07-11 21:48:04 EDT <StefanMolyneux> When people start trashing Bitcoin, it means they want to start a war.  I gave a speech 5 years ago about how the adoption of Bitcoin would end offensive wars.  Bitcoin vs. War: Can Bitcoin End War?  https://youtu.be/YDk62HApDa8 
1149495475344535552 2019-07-11 21:47:32 EDT <francispouliot_> Trump advisors received a report that his international sanctions and trade restriction agenda was being threatened  with circumvention via Bitcoin. That's probably what he cares about the most.
1149494637414866948 2019-07-11 21:44:12 EDT <pixelatedboat> Didya hear about this? President Trump has a problem with bitcoin - he says he’s worried the mines will collapse! *I do the Johnny Carson golf swing too enthusiastically and dislocate my shoulder*
1149493873846042624 2019-07-11 21:41:10 EDT <johnkim77> My thoughts on @realDonaldTrump Bitcoin & cryptocurrency tweet.   1. Don't read the tweet like most people.   2. There's no such thing as bad publicity.  3. It's reverse psychology.  4. The power of acknowledgement of existence.  5. He said I'm not "fan" there's no hate involved  pic.twitter.com/aiML4q3s9u
1149492256983801856 2019-07-11 21:34:45 EDT <RichardHeartWin> Well, since the President of the executive branch says #Bitcoin isn't money, those folks that have court cases open right now have a new argument to present.  pic.twitter.com/Tlyy1AbWtE

1149490196481634305 2019-07-11 21:26:33 EDT <kerooke> In September 2017, Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a fraud.  Bitcoin hash rate is up 1000% since then.  Good luck stopping Bitcoin, @realDonaldTrump.   You'll need it.
1149490032069079040 2019-07-11 21:25:54 EDT <Cernovich> I love that more people are talking about bitcoin.
1149490019020599302 2019-07-11 21:25:51 EDT <jimmysong> Thankfully, Bitcoin doesn't care what you think, even if you're really powerful.

1149489425287483394 2019-07-11 21:23:30 EDT <ErikVoorhees> Did the President of the United States just declare Bitcoin to be not money? I wonder if this has regulatory implications?  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192 …
1149489007060893696 2019-07-11 21:21:50 EDT <billbarhydt> This will completely legitimize bitcoin's existence for millions of people.
1149488344046297089 2019-07-11 21:19:12 EDT <matt_odell> You should buy some bitcoin secretly and then make it legal tender.  The price would sky rocket. Just something to think about.  If you really want to be remembered, have the US gov buy a stash as well. That would truly make america great again.
1149488253503848449 2019-07-11 21:18:50 EDT <Cernovich> I’m thrilled Trump tweeted about bitcoin. Everyone needs to learn about it!   Trump’s real attack was on Facebook which wants to print its own money, which it would ban conservatives from using.   Down with “Libra,” long with Bitcoin!
1149488207739772931 2019-07-11 21:18:39 EDT <the_moviebob> Trump is against Bitcoin?  Okay, then.  AHEM...  "President Donald J. Trump is 100% correct about this policy. It is the smart position."  Mark it, file it, now I've been fair. Carry on.

1149485258024185856 2019-07-11 21:06:56 EDT <francispouliot_> Ultimate opsec. Nobody will suspect that Donald's Trump policies that are increasing Bitcoin's value are due to his massive secret holdings or the fact U.S. government owns a huge stash. Ballsy hodler move.

1149485007657771009 2019-07-11 21:05:56 EDT <paranoidbull> The President of the United States basically just said that Bitcoin and Libra are threats to the US Dollar.   Think about that.   $BTC https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472285905940480 …
1149484984610115584 2019-07-11 21:05:51 EDT <maxkeiser> #Bitcoin will now humble the ‘Word’s Most Powerful Man.’  The world, I think, will have their ‘Emperor’s got no clothes’ moment regarding the $USD.  As BTC openly mocks Trump - and it will get worse - how does he come back from that?  2020 is now in play.  Trump just blew it.

1149482034252800000 2019-07-11 20:54:07 EDT <eugenegu> Getting your hands on unmarked bills is probably much harder than getting your hands on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This stuff is a bubble just like the Dutch tulip trade. Also, mining Bitcoin takes more energy and fossil fuels than mining gold, which is crazy.

1149382465569611776 2019-07-11 14:18:28 EDT <NAT3N3X> Rarely any coins pump when $BTC does but $NEX will be different. Its value is derived from the revenue of the exchange. When Bitcoin pumps the exchange volume will increase = dividends to $NEX holders increase = $NEX value increases. I'm betting on a winner, are you? @nashsocial

1149161196844490752 2019-07-10 23:39:14 EDT <LeoAW> One thing that makes Bitcoin so beautifully cultish is the promise of "messianic renewal," that Satoshi has come to forgive you of your debt.

1149130353807974400 2019-07-10 21:36:40 EDT <cryptunez> why do you tweet about bitcoin all day every day if you thinks its so bad?
1149130101671497733 2019-07-10 21:35:40 EDT <PeterSchiff> Today the Fed indicated that it wants more inflation, and that it will cut rates to bring that about.  Since inflation erodes the purchasing power of the dollar, investors sought a monetary alternative that acts as a store of value.  That's why they bought gold and not Bitcoin!
1149130030779371521 2019-07-10 21:35:23 EDT <_JustinMoon_> "seizure" vs "forfeiture"  - "seizure" is when they take your shit without your consent - "forfeiture" is when they use threats or violence to entice you to give up your shit  Bitcoin is no better than gold against "forfeiture", but far better against "seizure"
1149129451046952961 2019-07-10 21:33:05 EDT <iamDCinvestor> Will they say “built on Ethereum” or “built on blockchain technology like that used in Bitcoin”? 😂
1149126616519532546 2019-07-10 21:21:49 EDT <PeterSchiff> As today’s action shows a rally in gold does not mean Bitcoin will rally too.  In fact, one of the main reasons for Bitcoin’s prior gains was gold’s failure to rally. But if gold has finally broken out, there is no longer a reason for investors to settle for a digital imitation!
1149125752568340480 2019-07-10 21:18:23 EDT <nsquaredcrypto> Wow! Just did a quick look at $BTC momentum 1st 6 mos vs. 2nd 6 mos.  180% YTD means another +250% (give or take) over the next 6 months for #bitcoin.

1149119233563004928 2019-07-10 20:52:29 EDT <Rhythmtrader> Bitcoin going from "magic internet money" to $12,000 in the first place, is the crazy part of this wild story.  Going from here to $1,000,000 is the inevitable part.  Everyone wants bitcoin, they just don't all know it yet.

1149112500782338048 2019-07-10 20:25:44 EDT <jimmysong> The reason you get sticker shock more as you get older is because of inflation. Your mind is anchored to prices from years ago and has trouble adjusting.  Bitcoin will solve this.
1149112228341116928 2019-07-10 20:24:39 EDT <blockchainchick> Nice to wake up with Bitcoin down over 1k. Can you imagine how frantic traditional investors would be if their portfolio dropped by this much in 6 or so hours? Just another half day for us. BTD!

1149087984777433088 2019-07-10 18:48:19 EDT <VNumeris> Antpool had a 'software bug' that tried to exploit the coinbase transaction.  Fully nodes noticed & rejected the block.  This kills bcashers' narrative that miners control bitcoin.  Miners don't decide, fully validating nodes do.  Be a first class citizen.

This is normal and rational market behavior and does not mean bitcoin is crashing to $1,500 tomorrow.  That is all.  Ok, not entirely all. You guys are ridiculous.

1149009345746821121 2019-07-10 13:35:50 EDT <PeterSchiff> Bitcoin's market dominance is now over 65% and rising.   As altcoins lose value many see this as validation that Bitcoin is the winner, and is now digital gold.  But if altcoins can collapse, so too can Bitcoin.  That's one reason Bitcoin will never be a reliable store of value.

1148910746530660352 2019-07-10 07:04:02 EDT <RonnieMoas> Who will be the first countries to aggressively add #bitcoin to their sovereign wealth funds and/or as part of their strategic reserves? #Gold at $8 trillion is 35 times $BTC ($230 billion). This ratio could go to single-digits in the next few years and bring bitcoin to $100,000.

1148424840170409985 2019-07-08 22:53:13 EDT <BitcoinTina> Why do economists like Nouriel struggle with #bitcoin. Because #bitcoin is about a new economic paradigm. Explaining the why of bitcoin has nothing to do with the current way money, banking or the economy works. So they are completely blind.

1148285720374571008 2019-07-08 13:40:24 EDT <maxkeiser> The constant 10 minute emission schedule of #Bitcoin is the lure that will *always* attract miners - even acting irrationally - that pushes up hashrate with price following.

1148278754554327041 2019-07-08 13:12:43 EDT <RobertArtRobArt> WhatsApp, Facebook and Viber were all down. Bitcoin is never down.   But XRP is always down.  (massage your earlobes - it's a joke, it'll be fine - you'll ge though this)
1148275220693708801 2019-07-08 12:58:41 EDT <apenwarr> People have weird ideas about decentralization. Bitcoin is the most centralized financial system there is - all transactions in literally one big data structure.  Physical location is rarely what’s meant by decentralized software systems. Decentralize concepts, not just location.

1148108163624984576 2019-07-08 01:54:51 EDT <AnselLindner> Whitelists, regulate miners, enforce new taxes/go after old taxes, jail people, close exchs, enforce registering your sats with the govt, restrict on ramps/off ramps. There's lots of things they can attempt. They wouldn't kill Bitcoin, but it could be dangerous for individuals.

If Bitcoin was stable in value, bagholders wouldn’t buy and hold it hoping to moon, and miners couldn’t finance themselves by selling them rewards. Bitcoin can only be “number go up”.

1147731384712257536 2019-07-07 00:57:40 EDT <PetoVeritas> Bitcoin is the first and only money that is governed entirely by the alignment of incentives between ungovernable individuals (causing gridlock and therefore an unchangeable protocol) and not the legal-regulatory apparatus of high priests, founders, foundations, or roadmaps.

And don’t lose your money trading the chop on LTF trying to catch every move.   Follow these tips and you’ll be a lot richer than if you don’t!

1147698438294986752 2019-07-06 22:46:45 EDT <Rhythmtrader> The reason why bitcoin isn't already worth $1,000,000, is a simple lack of education.

1147659291190419456 2019-07-06 20:11:12 EDT <melikmanukyan> This does not grammatically make sense.  Cryptocurrency (a plural) cannot be *the* first. There can only be one first, what you meant to say is Bitcoin. Stop pulling an Amstrong.

1147656373380845568 2019-07-06 19:59:36 EDT <mipsytipsy> and in my experience heavily moralizing language like this is unnecessary and mostly provokes defensive reactions.  Your bitcoin app is not the Challenger.  Humans can't sustain that kind of paranoid attention to detail.  That's why we build tooling to do it for us.

Bullish neck line extension can take #bitcoin to a higher high above $14K with this pattern completion.

1147160420320333825 2019-07-05 11:08:52 EDT <APompliano> What needs to happen for Bitcoin to continue to appreciate in value against the US dollar?  Central banks need to stay addicted to printing money and cutting interest rates in an attempt to manipulate economies and currencies.  Thankfully for us, addictions are hard to quit!!
1147159080269537281 2019-07-05 11:03:32 EDT <BTC_Macro> Until Bitcoin makes a new ATH, there will likely not be a real alt season.  Yes, Altcoins will pump here and there, but the real parabolic gains will likely happen when BTC is done with its bull run.  Don’t miss out on BTC gains while Alts go sideways, lose value, or do nothing!

1147157446537826304 2019-07-05 10:57:03 EDT <APompliano> Peter will become one of Bitcoin’s loudest proponents in the next 24 months is my guess. Getting the vocal detractors to change their mind is worth it
1147157310650945536 2019-07-05 10:56:30 EDT <scottmelker> $BTC dominance is still an essential metric for discerning when alts are likely to perform well. But remember, there are FAR more alts for Bitcoin to "dominate" now than there were in the past, which skews the numbers. 60% dominance now is like 80% dominance in years past.
1147156589784305664 2019-07-05 10:53:38 EDT <scottmelker> The next alt season (yes, I think it will happen) will likely look different than the past. If this parabolic $BTC move was the same as 2017, we would have had 3 alt seasons already when bitcoin stopped to range. Up, down and sideways bitcoin have all been bad for alts thus far.
1147155926186696705 2019-07-05 10:51:00 EDT <diredmd2> It’s like if you take the best traits of #bitcoin and $EOS you get this awesome protocol called $Dash!

1147009127585058818 2019-07-05 01:07:41 EDT <CryptoGainz1> Is there a more beta move in existence than sending Peter Schiff bitcoin?  It’s like findom, only no hot woman in leather. Just an old dude who makes fun of bitcoin while you send it to him.

Once Bitcoin has finished her correct move, Bitcoin rally's to new ATH, alts bleed more, real Alt season begins after Bitcoin next rally.

1146961774844866560 2019-07-04 21:59:31 EDT <_Phil_Wilson_> It was reported that Craig asserted he left Bitcoin in August 2010 due to its use on SilkRoad ( launched Jan/Feb 2011 ).  He's mis-remembering.  *I* left in August 2010.  I still occasionally gave advice and help.  August was when I stopped doing any more coding on the project

1146921771502899200 2019-07-04 19:20:33 EDT <zooko> Hm. I think you're onto something here. The current dominant narrative in Bitcoin is *explicitly* empty. It's a pure Keynesian beauty contest, and adding content to it—such as by focusing on Bitcoin's actual functionality—actually undermines it by calling it into question.

1146884453660147712 2019-07-04 16:52:16 EDT <BTCsessions> Has anyone ever put together an estimate of how many TWh major banks consume each year when you factor in all the resources used by them and their employees? It would be a fun comparison between that and Bitcoin. Bonus points if it includes where that energy comes from.

1146714408543870977 2019-07-04 05:36:34 EDT <APompliano> There is no room for compromise.   Fiat currencies are being debased away & central banks are playing a fools game. They’re hurting people.  Bitcoin is better money & it will eventually become the global reserve currency.   If we don’t stand for something, we stand for nothing.

1146661531716923394 2019-07-04 02:06:27 EDT <BitKrabs> The reason Bitcoin and Gold are rising is simple! 📈  Instutional investors know that the economy will crash soon as the US Treasury curve has been dropping for months, and just went below the Fed Funds rate, which has signalled every recession within the last 40 years.

1146268745209458690 2019-07-03 00:05:40 EDT <roryhighside> There is no #cryptocurrency market, there is only a #Bitcoin market. #Altcoin hodlers merely don’t understand they are still holding bitcoin, but on the losing side of the pair. Alts are purely a leveraged instrument of Bitcoin, useful only for trade to stack more bitcoins. Facts

So I'm pretty confident we'll see BTC run a bit over the next week. Before we shift to alts more.  Then another LONG run... TBD 12,220. 15,140. 16,010. Stops

1146258974255263744 2019-07-02 23:26:50 EDT <loomdart> Honestly, optics wise (for bitcoin overall) having bitcoin be the main way to stack more bitcoin is much better, as opposed to hundreds of altcoins. Means there are alot less *negative* headlines that can be put out about bitcoin.
1146258971474485256 2019-07-02 23:26:49 EDT <loomdart> Bitmex has completely changed the game, leading to bitcoin trading as being the primary way of stacking more sats, as opposed to altcoin trading. Binance is trying with their small pool lottery IEO musical chairs, but it's too little IMO.

1145713894364602368 2019-07-01 11:20:53 EDT <BTC_Macro> If you wanted to buy Bitcoin at $14k, you should be dying to buy Bitcoin below $10k.  In bull markets, every dip is a chance to buy. In bear markets, every pump is a chance to short.  This strategy should be followed until the trend is broken. Don’t overthink this stuff.

I've also noticed many maximalists have a soft spot for @decredproject.  Could Decred be that competitor?

1145552454089695233 2019-07-01 00:39:23 EDT <l3l2ucelee> The reason normies will not own a bitcoin is because they don't understand it on a deep level to hold it for a 30% drop. They only want it when it's going up. This will only ensure they never own a full bitcoin or even a large amount of Sats. Education pays.

1145542805969727489 2019-07-01 00:01:02 EDT <ObiWanKenoBit> Bitcoin is like early electricity. Raw, dangerous, seems very volatile and hard to use. With time it'll start to feel safer, easier and normal. Like electricity it will inspire and power new unimaginable industries. And one day we’ll wonder how did we live without it?
