1012844654121738240 2018-06-29 19:45:57 EDT <hodloncomrades> Interesting fact. If anyone had purchased $100 of Bitcoin each day the Mayer Multiple was <1 since 2011-09-05 to 2018-06-28 $75,600 would have been invested. 4,504 Bitcoins would now be owned worth $27,924,800 Fees excluded. @TraceMayer @TIPMayerMultple

1012834027944972288 2018-06-29 19:03:44 EDT <MarketWatch> Bitcoin's latest plunge represents a roughly 60% tumble in bitcoin in the first half of 2018 and a 70% plunge from its peak near $20,000 late in 2017  https://on.mktw.net/2yVTFjR¬†

1012751120177848320 2018-06-29 13:34:17 EDT <zshrier> If you purchased bitcoin one year ago today, it:  - Appreciated over 650% in the six months following your purchase. - Declined about -70% in the six months after that.  If you held on, you're doing very well, +130%.  But you probably have some regrets, is my guess.
1012750530953732096 2018-06-29 13:31:57 EDT <HodlWhale> Crypto exchanges would logically mine #Bitcoin and #altcoins.

Add 25% for the standard commodities markup and you have $3,125 to $5,625 as regional bottoms. $5,625 is the bottom for most.

Personally, I hope any crypto that advances freedom & puts currency back in the hands of people will win. Bitcoin Core no longer has that quality, due to the choices it made.

1012740974102147073 2018-06-29 12:53:58 EDT <RonnieMoas> #bitcoin actually broke below $100 bln today. Little has changed in my view since I put out the recommendation at $2,570 on 3-Jul-17. Just a lot of noise. Now at $5,840. I see a 50% chance we retest $20K within 6-12 months & 25% chance we hit my $28K target by the end of 2019.

1012637271374417920 2018-06-29 06:01:54 EDT <trendycomputing> LN/second layers is pretty much the most epic tech to come out in the last decade, and yet it receives very little attention outside of the inner Bitcoin industry. People clearly have very little understanding of how computer science works.

1012564028349038592 2018-06-29 01:10:51 EDT <realcoindaddy> Coinbase literally created the adoption of ETH. On top of all of this Coinbase also has a16z's best interests at heart (their VC). So there are MANY MANY players and institutions that they need to satisfy the thirst of. Bitcoin? Inconsequential to them. An annoyance.
1012563462080245761 2018-06-29 01:08:36 EDT <realcoindaddy> This is what happens when corporate interest meets crypto. Greed on top of speculation. Greed squared. Coinbase's priority is NOT Bitcoin adoption. Their interests are self-aligned. Create the market which they dominate. Wall Street 2.0. This is the agenda, you know this.
1012563182668435457 2018-06-29 01:07:29 EDT <WhalePanda> They aren't here to help Bitcoin (adoption). Brian promoted every single attack on Bitcoin and stated how he has way more ETH than BTC.  We can at least hope that their new CEO will be more competent.
1012561967985385472 2018-06-29 01:02:40 EDT <WhalePanda> Coinbase is the worst, most of us already knew that.

When in reality their plans are mostly a clone of Bitcoin's.  That's dishonest, borderline fraud. Esp. when Green directly makes $$$ from ZCH.

Zcash, is no different than Bitcoin: Zcash doesn't scale at the base layer, so Green has proposed a Lightning-like layer for it.

I'm not giving investment advice.  FFS do your own research and come to your own opinion on bitcoin - you won't regret it.

1010389648110075904 2018-06-23 01:10:38 EDT <tedmrogers> 7/   Chances are good that #bitcoin will also be used as a currency in, at worst, several important use cases, e.g., large international settlements, and I believe it will become a global unit of account.

1010370874925637632 2018-06-22 23:56:03 EDT <jimmysong> Bitcoin is a long term investment. It takes courage, conviction, patience, wisdom and virtue to get through these bear markets.

1007559444916563968 2018-06-15 05:44:25 EDT <TotalBuzzKit> There is no 'total supply' metric that can be changed within the Bitcoin code. What can be changed is the size of the block mining reward and the reward reduction schedule. Total BTC supply (20,999,999.9769 BTC) depends on these two parameters.

You're sharing in a mathematically guaranteed pool of 12.5 blocks reward per 10 minutes. Period. There's not a cap on how much gold you can reasonably mine. It also doesn't get cheaper if mining gold stops.

I just think the media / journalists get wrapped up in epiphenomena and people along with it. One manifestation of this is "Gosh there's so much good news, why isn't the price going up?"

1005960538965172225 2018-06-10 19:50:56 EDT <eric_lombrozo> It seems much of the VC funding into new blockchains is focused on capturing some market, repackaging it, and reselling it (much like the SV-based "plaform" corps). This flies directly in the face of FOSS principles and the permissionless philosophy that underpins Bitcoin.

1005922707777687552 2018-06-10 17:20:37 EDT <jimmysong> The people that wanted to make *Bitcoin* better and not trying to sell tokens of one type or another have stayed. What I've noticed is that the good devs are the ones trying to make Bitcoin better. The bad ones generally try to sell more or less useless stuff.
1005922259297501184 2018-06-10 17:18:50 EDT <jimmysong> There has always been people that have been coding to make Bitcoin better. There have always been people trying to "get rich" by creating their own token starting way back with altcoins in 2011. The latter group moved to ETH because it was a better platform for them.
1005921885056618498 2018-06-10 17:17:21 EDT <jimmysong> Third, the Coinbase API is hardly the bastion of developer activity. Real development was going on in wallets, alternate implementations and of course Bitcoin core. The people in those things, did they move to ETH? Perhaps, but I don't recall many.

1005805784637165568 2018-06-10 09:36:00 EDT <timevalueofbtc> Bitcoin is interdisciplinary. It is highly improbable that any one person can be an expert in all aspects. Most that are experts in applied cryptography are not experts in Austrian economics. That is why bitcoin is inherently a collaborative process.
1005805031025766400 2018-06-10 09:33:01 EDT <lopp> Voting isn't a part of Bitcoin's consensus process. Some have misinterpreted Satoshi's "1-CPU-1-vote" statement as if it applies regardless of the rules being enforced by individual users. If you wish to be subject to the whims of a few powerful entities, use a different network.

1005804071926882304 2018-06-10 09:29:12 EDT <pierre_rochard> This is spot on - as a practical matter, the consensus of which side of the fork is the Schelling point is determined *ahead* of the hard fork. It's impossible to shift after the fork.   In other words, if you want Bitcoin to increase the base block size limit, try to fork again.  https://twitter.com/stephanlivera/status/1005798763732992001¬†‚Ä¶

1005762268041306112 2018-06-10 06:43:05 EDT <LucidInvestment> My current view of Bitcoin. Short term neutral, BUT, a penetration of $7,026 will change that to negative with a target of $6,300. The low an hour ago was $7,175. Intermediate term negative with a target of $4,900. That target increases by $82 per week. Long term target $1,000.

1005385202900832256 2018-06-09 05:44:46 EDT <Beautyon_> The only correct response to the "Bitcoin wastes electricity" meme is to answer with, "Then why are you mining Bitcoin then?" to which you will get the answer, "I don't mine Bitcoin!", whereupon you say, "Then what does it have to do with you?" Anything else is a waste of air.

1005383827316002816 2018-06-09 05:39:18 EDT <peterktodd> Bitcoin's long-term¬π lack of an inflation tax is attractive to buyers; even if it leads to a deflationary spiral that's not harmful to Bitcoin itself. Any Keynesian economist who isn't just trying to badmouth Bitcoin would recognize that.  1) Short-term, still high inflation.
1005383826502307840 2018-06-09 05:39:18 EDT <peterktodd> Keynesian criticisms of Bitcoin - e.g. that it'll fail due to a deflationary spiral - don't seem to be made by unbiased economists anyway. In my experience talking to actual Keynesian economists they recognize that inflation is a tax, and obviously people like avoiding taxes.

1005119636696981505 2018-06-08 12:09:30 EDT <JoelKatz> What does bitcoin do if there's a 51% attack? What did bitcoin do in 2013? Decentralized systems stay open because the community can always hard fork if the code stops reflecting their values. That's how decentralization works.
1005119564588421121 2018-06-08 12:09:13 EDT <tracyalloway> A bitcoin scammer pretending to be Tyler WInklevoss has messaged me on Instagram.
1005118163862749184 2018-06-08 12:03:39 EDT <JoelKatz> None of that is true. Literally none of it. The vast majority of Ripple's XRP is in on-ledger escrow. And the XRP community can use the amendment process (like a hard fork) to respond to such an unlikely and extreme threat just as bitcoin did in 2013.

1004306538977165312 2018-06-06 06:18:32 EDT <JoelKatz> Ah, hand waving. Ripple is 100% focused on positioning XRP for this use case, partnering with banks, with deployed products in live use. Compared to lots of people building lots of stuff. And no hint of a revenue model for building this for bitcoin.

1003596960220286976 2018-06-04 07:18:55 EDT <LucidInvestment> I believe that it is important that after Bitcoin prices began falling from the swing high of $9,949 on 5/05 that counter trend rally's have remained weak. This is bearish behavior. It could change, but hasn't yet. Short term neutral, intermediate negative, long term negative.

1003594987509026816 2018-06-04 07:11:05 EDT <LucidInvestment> The short term movement on Bitcoin prices continues to frustrate, both bears and bulls. Swing low occurred 5/28 at 9:30 ET. Since, we have had 5 higher highs and 4 higher lows...until 3 1/2 hours ago where we broke down from swing high of $7,790 to current $7,516. Still neutral.

In the long term, the crypto gets dependent on its leader & is unable to compete with Bitcoin on decentralization.

All the rest are trivial for their makers to change, so they do not compete with Bitcoin on being hard money. It'll take many people time to realize that, but market lessons usually take time.

1003082179935498240 2018-06-02 21:13:22 EDT <justicemate> I'd like to go back to technicals. Both forks of Bitcoin are Bitcoin. BCH is 'also' Bitcoin. Interestingly its economic operation most closely matches the original definition by Satoshi.
1003080535382650883 2018-06-02 21:06:50 EDT <aaronsevivas> I, for one, agree with @rogerkver.  BCH is Bitcoin.  Context is everything in all aspects of life.  BTC, Lightning & Segwit has nothing to do nor does it even point remotely in the direction the inventor of Bitcoin stated in the white paper.  Even BTC supporters see that.

1003056743948083201 2018-06-02 19:32:18 EDT <_Kevin_Pham> Ethereum is attractive to devs because tokens give them the ability to make millions in a short amount of time with minimal work/skill.  Bitcoin on the other hand has an extremely high barrier to entry (think nuclear/aerospace software) and financial rewards aren't immediate.

1002490984113102848 2018-06-01 06:04:10 EDT <francispouliot_> The main upside of banks blockading Bitcoin bank accounts (account closures/freeze, censorship, seizure) is that Bitcoin businesses are incentivized to keep money in Bitcoin, as the risks are limited. Bitcoin volatility (high frequency) is not fatal, unlike banking black swan.
