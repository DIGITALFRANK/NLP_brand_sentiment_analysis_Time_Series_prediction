1035140520417345536 2018-08-30 08:21:46 EDT <anambroid> Can you picture institutional miner accumulation from the retail miner due to them getting ridiculous electric deals while having the capital to absorb the hardware on top of the bitcoin themselves?
1035140507259887617 2018-08-30 08:21:43 EDT <anambroid> What everyone knows electricity price closely relates to miner breakeven in regards to Bitcoin price. So people are scavenging for the "median breakeven" for bitcoin miners to see where the bottom is for price.

1034771825610420224 2018-08-29 07:56:43 EDT <TheStalwart> People are always coming up with Bitcoin analogs ("digital gold")  But IMO, Bitcoin = digital alcohol.  Alcohol is a way of turning a thing that rots (fruit, grain) into something permanent and transportable (wine, whiskey). Bitcoin, theoretically, does the same with electricity.
1034770559970762753 2018-08-29 07:51:41 EDT <mindstatex> I have every confidence that Bitcoin can do what it has been designed to do: Indefinitely scale on-chain as a small world network.  The challenges lie in the code optimisation, not the design.   I will happily ride out this experiment to success or failure first before any other.

1034056238315843585 2018-08-27 08:33:13 EDT <MSkieller> I care about bitcoin and the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash first and foremost. Sure I think tokens are great. But the "killer app" clearly is electronic cash. We need to scale bitcoin to a magnitude that we can deliver this "killer app" to the entire world now:)

1034036315011145729 2018-08-27 07:14:03 EDT <Beautyon_> The incentive for enemies to switch to Bitcoin is very deep and large.

If Bitcoin replaces even 20% of all fiat or becomes "The Money of the Internet" you can bet they'll want a big part of it.

Legitimate registered business in Florida. You can use it to buy basically anything on the internet with cryptocurrencies.
1033239033013403648 2018-08-25 02:25:56 EDT <JoelKatz> And if you want to argue that the hypothetical is absurd, well, that's kind of my point. We all have long since accepted whatever happened back then as gospel going forward. And the need to verify it has high cost -- takes much longer to start up a bitcoin node than XRPL.
1033238749885485057 2018-08-25 02:24:49 EDT <justgoodstuff11> Bitcoin, Litecoin and #DigiByte are all three great, will coexist and will have their own place in the crypto world. As they are the big three real working decentralized UXTO blockchains. DigiByte has the greatest potential for growth though.
1033238746802532353 2018-08-25 02:24:48 EDT <JoelKatz> Let's try a hypothetical: Suppose a careful review of the bitcoin blockchain revealed a transaction that was mishandled years ago due to a bug nobody noticed. Would we unwind years of transactions or would we just accept the bug as the right thing?
1033238430077997056 2018-08-25 02:23:33 EDT <JoelKatz> We had the benefit of seeing these suboptimal decision in the bitcoin design and code so we were able to avoid these high costs that have no corresponding benefits. There is nothing you can do about a mistake that happened years ago before you even started using the network.
1033237065549266944 2018-08-25 02:18:07 EDT <melikmanukyan> #Blockchain, not #Bitcoin is a byproduct of postmodernism toxicity.  The entire premise of a blockchain is to create objective reality or discover 'truth' (consensus). These fools believe that they can reject Bitcoin and create thousands of little subjective bubbles and pockets.

1032431898004529152 2018-08-22 20:58:40 EDT <jchervinsky> 9/ Long story short, this isn't a great sign for the bitcoin ETF bulls. The SEC's demand is clear. They want to see:  (i) a surveillance-sharing agreement . . . (ii) with a regulated market . . . (iii) of significant size.  That seems like a tough request to satisfy in 2018.
1032431891700432901 2018-08-22 20:58:39 EDT <jchervinsky> 4/ The SEC relied heavily on last month's denial of the Winklevoss ETF appeal, which found that:  - bitcoin markets are not inherently resistant to manipulation - to deter manipulation, exchanges need a surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size

1032024385681543174 2018-08-21 17:59:22 EDT <BobLoukas> Bitcoin didn't need an ETF to go from $0.01 to $20,000.  This is getting blown out of proportion.  Fact is, at $115B, still a tiny market cap.  Assets need to go through price discovery, back filling, profit taking, bull/bear Cycles.  All part of the process.

1032023036684251136 2018-08-21 17:54:00 EDT <patio11> In other news, Bitcoiners write letters to the SEC asking them to approve Bitcoin ETFs so that retail can purchase them in IRAs. That‚Äôs a literal thing. The person writing that letter wrote that this would improve prices.  That person is the regulatory shock troop of a scam.
1032021352679497728 2018-08-21 17:47:19 EDT <patio11> I have a feeling that techies of my acquaintance will feel uneasy about the notion that their lambo was bought by the victim of an investment scam. And one of the innovations of Bitcoin is that it creates a scam where every participant can semi-plausibly deny scamming.

1031230618519007232 2018-08-19 13:25:13 EDT <econoar> The Bitcoin Paradox:  "It is a currency, deflationary and a store of value!"  A deflationary currency disincentives people to actually spend. So, lack of transactions means very little is paid in fees to miners. What happens when supply cap is hit? No one spends and miners leave.

The idea that altcoins can coexist as money in long term free market is the scam.  The idea that an altcoin can survive and Bitcoin will die is the most improbable longshot on the history of finance.

1030099110400020480 2018-08-16 10:29:00 EDT <PeterSchiff> In defending #Bitcoin, Brian Kelly claimed that nobody uses #gold anymore, but it's still worth $1,200 per ounce.

The fact that bitcoin has held prices over $5,000 for this long despite being under them for 90% of its existence is impressive.

Science have proven that the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain can scale just fine on-chain.  LN is a clown car that can't scale and is a UX nightmare at the same time. No realistic competition from LN.

1028771360116494337 2018-08-12 18:33:00 EDT <thecryptokidd> There's a lot of ignorance and flawed understanding of Bitcoin in general.

1028762776108331008 2018-08-12 17:58:53 EDT <NickSzabo4> Dumb money is a high time preference addiction. I care much more about Bitcoin's utility as a globally seamless and censorship-resistant store of value and medium of wealth transfer -- hopefully in future with more secure & friendlier wallets.
1028760323619254272 2018-08-12 17:49:09 EDT <360_trader> I‚Äôm a huge believer in #crypto and I invest big - but only that which ‚ÄúI‚Äù can afford to lose.

1028759321507713025 2018-08-12 17:45:10 EDT <ImranLorgat> Never understood the hype of Bitcoin ETFs.

1028756404520271872 2018-08-12 17:33:34 EDT <francispouliot_> Bitcoins useful festures: immutability, censorship-resistance and trustless valition and rule enforcement are a result of its network effects, not features of code. You don't get bitcoin's features by copying the code. And cheap database entries are not a scarce ressource.
1028756105302888448 2018-08-12 17:32:23 EDT <harrisonhuntr> My close friend @alexadelman is launching probably the most consumer + mass market friendly crypto company (@trylolli) v soon, where you can get bitcoin back for shopping similar to ebates. should be awesome, check it out and get free bitcoin:  https://www.lolli.com/?referral=SybhAUZQm¬†‚Ä¶
1028754800396120070 2018-08-12 17:27:12 EDT <francispouliot_> Scarcity drives value.  E.g. someone can fork Civic easily and implement the same system with Bitcoin payments. Utility only leads to value insofar as the useful feature is hard to reproduce. Forcing use of $CVC by banning all other currencies won't work if Civic forks work too.

I'll say it again - it's short sighted. Bitcoin Cash is probably in fact building their product better with less people, because they are more organized.

It doesn't matter whether you bought Bitcoin this year at $18,000 or at $6,000. 28 months later you are a winner. Never think of what you could have made. Consider only what you are making. There is no bad time to buy decent cryptocurrency.

1028388132981538817 2018-08-11 17:10:12 EDT <crazy_crypto> Saying that Bitcoin or alts won't reverse or at least have a big bounce is the equivalent of saying that Bitcoin would never correct when it was reaching for 20k.

1027263694869340161 2018-08-08 14:42:05 EDT <brucefenton> Down markets are a good time to examine the way people working on projects behave: are they scurrying, trying to repair things or are they building & hodling with interests aligned.  Bitcoin is a great example of a project that every day keeps on with more quality development.

1027260317070446592 2018-08-08 14:28:39 EDT <brucefenton> 1/ I don‚Äôt think the ETF news is the major driver for the market sell off.  More likely, it‚Äôs a continued adjustment in value for a variety of projects with low chances of success.   In this downturn Bitcoin and other crypto assets are affected because the markets are correlated.

Thousands of miners spending, in some cases, millions of dollars each to find it. Can the value be less than the effort? The value would have to be hundreds of millions.

1026174231330078720 2018-08-05 14:32:56 EDT <Bitcoin_Beyond> Continuing to lie to users that using Bitcoin as a mesh settlement layer with LN (money transmitter) hubs is the way forward is either malicious or willfully ignorant.  Take time to understand how Bitcoin allows true peer to peer commerce - don't blindly trust "thoughtleaders".
1026174229690175488 2018-08-05 14:32:56 EDT <Bitcoin_Beyond> Saying Andreas is wrong is surely to ruffle feathers, but it's time for real education in this space to emerge.  We cannot continue to mislead developers and users on the nature of Bitcoin.  The protocol scales without concern for rasperry pi nodes, and Core has no roadmap.

It just gives you a chance to continue to accumulate.  No use seeing big % gains on your small $ investment when you could be seeing them on a larger scale.

Today that would be called treason. This is the 300 year chapter that ends. #bitcoin

1024528465331146752 2018-08-01 01:33:15 EDT <Datavetaren> Krugman is saying that #bitcoin ‚Äùerases‚Äù 300 years of monetary history. In some sense this reminds me of the old guard in physics who were upset that quantum mechanics ‚Äùerased‚Äù 300 years of Newtonian. But the ‚Äùsolar system model‚Äù of the atom is dead. So is Keynesian economics.

1024522633814003712 2018-08-01 01:10:05 EDT <NTmoney> Just a year ago, the popular belief was that a hard fork would destroy Bitcoin. $98B+ in value creation followed instead (~$85B increase in BTC mkt cap and ~$13B BCH mkt cap).
