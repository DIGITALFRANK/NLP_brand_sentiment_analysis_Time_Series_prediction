1085746766882910212 2019-01-16 22:52:56 EDT <technocrypto> So to anyone in the #Bitcoin community who's gleefully spouting nonsense about the #Ethereum #Constantinople delay, just be aware that there are plenty of other costs you impose on Bitcoin itself by doing this garbage.

1085296003052462081 2019-01-15 17:01:45 EDT <hodlonaut> Buying Grin probably means you think it will appreciate against BTC. Grin will print 27million coins every year. It's inflation rate will go from 400% in 3 months, to 100% in a year. Bitcoin inflation will go from around 3.8% now, to 1.8% in 2020.  Good luck out-SoV'ing Bitcoin.

1085294840198291456 2019-01-15 16:57:08 EDT <JoelKatz> Compare this scenario with an analogous situation of, say, China passing laws that affect bitcoin miners. XRP users can easily ignore Ripple. Much harder to ignore miners. Ultimately, both systems will give users want because nothing can force users to accept anything less. 1/2

Bitcoin won't uplift people from poverty, hard work will. Bitcoin doesn't change that. Bitcoin is just another way to gain from work, its not a magic pill.

1085061881079812098 2019-01-15 01:31:26 EDT <romanitup> The problem with bitcoin-core code is that if I wanted to understand it and be able to navigate & contribute to it, there's no place to start. There's no manual that says "look here and here for these things".
1085058684378640384 2019-01-15 01:18:44 EDT <cullenroche> I still think Bitcoin is a very flawed form of money, but the argument for a decentralized form of money makes a lot of sense when seen thru the lens of an economy where hyperinflation is always a concern.
1085058119812603904 2019-01-15 01:16:29 EDT <bascule> If you ignore the parts about how Bitcoin is supposed to be useful for electronic payments, what remains is literally a Ponzi scheme.

You try to bootstrap a cryptocurrency with PoW  and you're vulnerable to all sorts of attacks. It worked best for Bitcoin because nobody understood what it was, allowing it time to mature to a point, where it's hard to attack.

1083151541551288320 2019-01-09 19:00:26 EDT <getongab> We are using free speech money, bitcoin, to ensure that our payments are not censored.   Period.   That's a powerful message.   It's authentic.   It's a real need.   Not just for Gab, but for the world.
1083151538300674049 2019-01-09 19:00:25 EDT <getongab> Gab is the de facto leading example, aside from Wikileaks, of why bitcoin exists and will inevitably scale across the world. We are not creating our own useless "utility token." We are not utilizing some garbage dapp or protocol that no normal person cares about.
1083151535255633920 2019-01-09 19:00:24 EDT <getongab> We really do believe we can quickly become the largest bitcoin community in the world very quickly. We have what no other vaporware crypto app has: a real community of users, customers, and shareholders all working to make Gab succeed so that free speech can thrive online.

1082815552588922880 2019-01-08 20:45:20 EDT <hosseeb> But this is super expensive, and the only way to make money off it is by simultaneously shorting the currency. Right now you can't short enough Bitcoin to make this attack profitable. This attack is only worrying if you're extremely well-capitalized and willing to burn money.
1082815552005988353 2019-01-08 20:45:19 EDT <hosseeb> You've got two choices. Say you're China and you want to completely destroy Bitcoin‚Äîyou can mine empty blocks (and ignore everyone else's). Thus, the only blocks in the longest chain will be empty. This makes Bitcoin basically unusable for everyone else.

The Foundation was invloved with the UFC for 232, and extreme bitcoin supporters threw a fit. This is where everything started.  Nowhere does he say all bitcoiners are extremists.

1082229450631196672 2019-01-07 05:56:22 EDT <Beautyon_> The rarity of Bitcoin developers is an underestimated barrier to entry for any company wanting to participate. The executive class doesn't understand this because they're computer illiterate. Normally a talent drought is a bad thing, but in Bitcoin it is a good thing.

For example: BTC hashing is 75% controlled from China, despite thousands of full nodes, only a handful control Bitcoin's history/txns.

Fact: the rise of maximalism directly threatens the livelihood of all rent-seeking altcoiners.  https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1082006797421035521¬†‚Ä¶

1081858009800863744 2019-01-06 05:20:24 EDT <hodlonaut> The world has never seen a phenomenon that even comes close to Bitcoin. Absolute robustness. Absolute immutability. Absolute censorship resistance. Absolute truth.  Very few grasp how enormous this is, and how profoundly it will change the world.
1081856066059669504 2019-01-06 05:12:40 EDT <brian_trollz> This is yet another reason we can't raise the blocksize besides just the inherent scalability of the chain. If you don't let market pressures weed out stupidity a million dumb things will try to free ride on Bitcoin's security, getting recursively worse.

That's why you have to rely on NON-blockchain solutions like LN or Liquid, because the chain is unusable for payments. (Also Bitcoin isn't censorship resistant)

1080676617901375494 2019-01-02 23:05:58 EDT <getongab> The future of money is a store of value that can not be censored.   One that exists outside of a system of control.   One that levels the playing field and takes a scorched earth approach to the existing power structures.   The future is free speech money.  The future is bitcoin.

1080039065922228224 2019-01-01 04:52:34 EDT <MustStopMurad> Note that Bitcoin started with 1 owner, 1 node, 1 miner, 1 dev, and where we are today. Ownership has been decentralizing.  Bitcoin indubitably is undergoing a process of monetization. This process, will take decades, and is by no means a linear, predictable process.  pic.twitter.com/1O1g1pyePt

1080018938392649728 2019-01-01 03:32:35 EDT <cryptospaced> Low volume pullbacks after the recent high volume upmoves are a good sign for alts. QTUM and TRX 3D charts are good examples. Bitcoin pullbacks also on low volume on 3D. A significant move down would change this, but this is what's happening now.

1079996889553137664 2019-01-01 02:04:58 EDT <_ty13r> LND is a fork of BTCD which is the foundation of which Decred was derived from. BTCD was created as an alt implemantion of Bitcoin Core, but met with overwhelming contention. Cont to no acknowledge their efforts reinforces the reasons for which Decred was created to begin with.

1079989639543439361 2019-01-01 01:36:09 EDT <cryptoworld202> Bitcoin, crypto in general, and blockchain are going to surprise people in 2019 with some big things.
1079982916359335936 2019-01-01 01:09:27 EDT <isiahmeadows1> Also, I want a decentralized, anonymous currency. I just feel the foundation people are using are severely limiting progress. Blockchains have a very low throughput on transactions, and they over-rely on mining for checking - this is part of what's fueling Bitcoin's massive fall.
