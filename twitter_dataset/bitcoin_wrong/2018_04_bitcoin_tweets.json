990740481461059584 2018-04-29 19:51:52 EDT <Nicholas_Merten> This is the greatest misconception I hear about crypto and why many like @officialmcafee aren't crazy for saying Bitcoin will be $1,000,000. The world is beginning to realize just how worthless fiat is. Doesn't mean you can't trade it to someone who still believes it has value.  https://twitter.com/wallaceiam/status/990490930380705792¬†‚Ä¶

990656769880870912 2018-04-29 14:19:14 EDT <theonevortex> LN is intended to be a live, global, small payment, super fast network. In time, as the bitcoin price grows it will deal with larger and larger txs, but for large transactions and large batching of transactions, that's best done on layer 1.
990655688236941312 2018-04-29 14:14:56 EDT <theonevortex> LN is not a separate currency or IOU. It is a network of cryptographically secured payment channels locked (not pegged) to bitcoin's blockchain via smart contracts.

989264321300447232 2018-04-25 18:06:08 EDT <Adrian_Xt> This looks like a Bunch of people didn't understand why Bitcoin split. It's as if not upgrading the 1MB transaction limit was a right & upgrading a sin. It looks like they sold their BCH and are now vulnerable. Their only option now is consensus by Proof of Social Media.  https://twitter.com/brianchoffman/status/988907114318958594¬†‚Ä¶
989264034112327682 2018-04-25 18:05:00 EDT <jratcliff> BCH is an alt-coin with a premine.  It never had consensus of any kind.  There is no difference between BCH and BTG or any other fork-coin out there.  It is not 'Bitcoin'.  It never had consensus, hashpower, node support, exchange support or anything else.  Bitcoin = BCH is a lie

The same is not true of the future global reserve asset, bitcoin. It may be used as a currency for certain use cases but it is Gold 2.0 at its ‚Äúcore‚Äù :)
988651444503920640 2018-04-24 01:30:47 EDT <real_vijay> There's a good reason for this. The monetization of Bitcoin will change the world for the better.

The former is the process of monetization while the latter is market cornering, which cannot last.

987295588977991680 2018-04-20 07:43:06 EDT <WhalePanda> "Fraud: wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain." Only reason they call it Bitcoin is to lure in unsuspecting new people to dump their altcoin on (financial gain), simple as that. The "killing babies" narrative shows how desperate he is.
987295220260884480 2018-04-20 07:41:38 EDT <WhalePanda> BCash came into existence as an attempt to strong-arm Bitcoin users and businesses. It was backed and funded by 3 people: Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and Craig Wright. Again: no issue with them forking off, their choice and they want to try to take a different route, which is fine.
987295124152635392 2018-04-20 07:41:15 EDT <WhalePanda> $BCH isn't a scam, but it kinda is. BCash isn't a scam because #Bitcoin is an open-source project and anyone can fork it (and sometimes it feels that almost everyone did at some point). The software isn't the problem, it's certain people behind it that are committing fraud.

986649457549828097 2018-04-18 12:55:36 EDT <ziggamon> The bitcoin fees narrative must change. What went on in Q4 2017 was not "the new normal", it was a deviation. It was a temporary scaling issue that has since been adressed.  Yes, long term bitcoin transactions may become expensive. No, we're still years away from that.  https://twitter.com/ziggamon/status/975067727785349121¬†‚Ä¶

985700894808436737 2018-04-15 22:06:21 EDT <jimmysong> 3/ I suspect this is also why many simply don't like Bitcoin. Not because they don't think it'll work, but because they don't *want* it to work. That would invalidate the world view that they have.

985168642844364801 2018-04-14 10:51:22 EDT <AriDavidPaul> 1/ People consistently and massively underestimate how long it takes to engineer new uses in cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin was built on 30+ years of work and still had major bugs after 4 years.  Lightning Network took 3 years from draft paper to barebones deployment.

985159351030763521 2018-04-14 10:14:27 EDT <JoelKatz> The problem is that bitcoin, like all cryptos, is a bundle of complex engineering compromises. One solution for every problem doesn't work. Instead, we need light, simple interoperability protocols so systems can compete and spur innovation.
985158803552423936 2018-04-14 10:12:16 EDT <BobMcElrath> I second that. Many core devs patiently explained many things about bitcoin to me over the years. It was very clear to me long ago that all the best minds were working on bitcoin, and virtually every other project was based on smoke, mirrors, and Wikipedia articles.

"Innovations" that would get paid zero in Bitcoin are getting paid a lot in altcoin markets. Hence, I don't think altcoins would disappear with development rewards.

984478469252943872 2018-04-12 13:08:52 EDT <MeniRosenfeld> 7/7 "BCH is better than BTC, technically and ideologically, and closer to original vision" is a claim I disagree with, but at least it's a legitimate opinion I can understand. "BCH is Bitcoin" is not, and you shouldn't agree with it even if you agree with the 1st one.
984478096941338626 2018-04-12 13:07:23 EDT <MeniRosenfeld> 3/7 The problem, of course, is that it aspires to call itself Bitcoin. In this view, BCH is the direct continuation of the original Bitcoin currency, while at some point BTC forked away. But did you stop to think what this narrative would mean?

It could fall to $2,000, be seen as a 90% discount while being up over 100% from previous years. Perceptions.

This is why the segwit iteration of bitcoin fails the test.   Bitcoin Cash is the economically viable anarchist cryptocurrency.

982907768976834561 2018-04-08 05:07:28 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> Bitcoin is like the Internet in 1996 - if instead of building websites, everyone just bought up domain names and waited for their prices to moon. How is the ecosystem supposed to evolve, if nobody is using the tech for its purpose? Unless HODL turns into SPEDN, Bitcoin is a joke.

There are hundreds of thousands behind NATs.   2. An Ethereum full node is a farce because they can no longer do real syncs, everyone resorts to something known as fast-sync.

When BCH forked they left the rules that had found consensus, and consensus is what defines bitcoin. BCH is not bitcoin, it's an alt coin no one uses.

981576306541383681 2018-04-04 12:56:42 EDT <CryptoMichNL> Small update on #bitcoin:  We couldn't keep the $7.000 area as support and fell to the $6.800 area and a spike even lower. Now it's important that we keep this level, if we don't, I do see a fast drop towards $6.000 area incoming.  Stacked buys there and watching for now.

BCH has Flexible Transactions, which also fixes malleability.

981091329479356416 2018-04-03 04:49:35 EDT <VitalikButerin> 47. Samson: "If you're accepting payments in altcoins, there's very little liquidity"  IMO not true since ~2015 for the top ~10-50 coins. Just use the altcoins as a payment channel; when your balance gets to ~$100 convert to bitcoin through shapeshift and sell to fiat from there
981090878490951681 2018-04-03 04:47:47 EDT <VitalikButerin> 45. "It's easier to migrate from bitcoin core to altcoins than to migrate from bitcoin core to lightning" - this is actually a very interesting point: lightning only benefits from bitcoin's *currency* network effect, NOT *tech/development* network effect.

981083341347672064 2018-04-03 04:17:50 EDT <VitalikButerin> 28. "When you're talking about miners, Bitcoin is sub-linear. It actually gets better the bigger the network is. That's some of the stuff people don't want you to know" - what does that even mean?
981083123445243905 2018-04-03 04:16:58 EDT <VitalikButerin> 27. The Bitcoin network is highly connected, and therefore a transaction gets broadcasted across the network very quickly. Therefore double spending is not worth worrying about. True in some cases (many consumer-merchant payments), false in others; the distinction matters.

Losses somewhat overstated as txs crowded out by fees were lower value than txs that stay, but still serious.
981078082248261632 2018-04-03 03:56:57 EDT <VitalikButerin> 18. "This will result in fewer users ... less financial privacy ... less censorship resistance". The financial privacy bit may actually be true; I heard from third-party sources that bitcoin tumblers were the first type of transaction to stop taking place as fees started going up

981073902414647297 2018-04-03 03:40:20 EDT <VitalikButerin> 8. The discourse on "the four primitives" and layer 2 scaling solutions as the sole domain of innovation is clearly well developed now. Eh, bitcoin forked now and so it's clear that everyone on the core side actually has bought into the vision, and I guess we'll see how it goes.
981073361714364417 2018-04-03 03:38:11 EDT <VitalikButerin> 7. "Bitcoin is divisible and spendable".... umm, I don't think it's possible to spend less than ~10000 satoshis. Sure, you can use lightning channels, but entering a channel itself costs that amount, so you can't collect a payment *for the first time* if it's smaller

980489303045410817 2018-04-01 12:57:21 EDT <francispouliot_> When you have a 50 year+ vision for Bitcoin, you realize what kind of a head-start in life you can give your descendants by passing on some bitcoins.

980436558594629632 2018-04-01 09:27:45 EDT <LucidInvestment> For those hoping for lower prices in Bitcoin because you were late to the party, your time will arrive. In my opinion Bitcoin is here to stay and bargain prices are ahead. Not so, with many, most, all of the other cryptos.

980435721868709889 2018-04-01 09:24:26 EDT <LucidInvestment> There are many implications to Bitcoin Hyperwave breaking below Phase 3 line. To me the most important: 1) Bitcoin will now drop to $4,000, which will have a small possibility of reversing price action. If it doesn't prices drop to below $1,000. 2) GBTC and all Alts will follow.
980434244513226752 2018-04-01 09:18:34 EDT <LucidInvestment> Reality check. Bitcoin prices are $1,800 below Phase 3 line and the weekly bar closes in less than 12 hours. To me, this means the Hyperwave is ending with a target below $1,000. True there is a small possibility that Phase 2 holds at $4,000 and we begin another Wave.
