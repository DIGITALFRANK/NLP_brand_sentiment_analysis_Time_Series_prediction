1023505691867328512 2018-07-29 05:49:07 EDT <BashCo_> That‚Äôs commendable, but unfortunately the Bcash camp did not go their own way. They‚Äôre still complaining about the lack of a hard fork for Bitcoin, while Bcash is increasingly malicious and downright scammy.

1023112528510046208 2018-07-28 03:46:49 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> It‚Äôs obvious that a Bitcoin ETF would just attract lazy money into Bitcoin, with only an interest of making USD profits. These people would have zero interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed, only to go up in USD terms. It speaks volumes of the cupidity and hypocrisy of Bitcoin shills.
1023112526068936706 2018-07-28 03:46:49 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> The twist that a Bitcoin ETF would increase adoption is a transparent lie. People would just buy the ETF, and hope someone else will go through the pain of figuring out how to do stuff with Bitcoin. At least now to properly invest in Bitcoin you have to learn how to use a wallet.
1023112523325865984 2018-07-28 03:46:48 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> Can someone who understands crypto, explain to me how a Bitcoin ETF will help the network?

Now with aluminum prices low, those smelters can be repurposed for BTC mining.

1022431776059392001 2018-07-26 06:41:45 EDT <Beautyon_> Once people stop treating Bitcoin as a single function (sending money) and start thinking about it as a programming platform (what it is) then it will be much harder to make the claim that it should be treated as a form of money, subject to all the garbage associated with that.

1022159362964561921 2018-07-25 12:39:17 EDT <matt_odell> The reason twitter scam accounts use ethereum and not bitcoin is because ethereum users are used to sending eth to contract addresses in return for tokens/eth. It's part of the normal eth UI flow. Send first, then receive after. Makes it ideal for impersonation/giveaway scams.

1021886837932126208 2018-07-24 18:36:22 EDT <LukeDashjr> "Bitcoin Core" cultism/idolatry is NOT a good thing, and in fact is harmful to Bitcoin. Don't blindly follow "what the Core devs do" - that just ends up with yet another centralised currency like USD or BCH.  Instead, try to make informed decisions about what software you use.
1021886836627648514 2018-07-24 18:36:22 EDT <LukeDashjr> PSA: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Core are two different things. Bitcoin Core is an *implementation* of Bitcoin - one of quite a few options. If it were to change the protocol rules without community support, it would become an altcoin, and Bitcoin itself would not change.

But I can't imagine the SEC will approve the first ever bitcoin ETF without taking all the time allowed by law.   Sorry. Get ready to wait.
1021795233825214465 2018-07-24 12:32:22 EDT <jchervinsky> 7/ The SEC wasn't making a decision about all of the pending bitcoin ETFs today; it was just handling the next step in the process for the Direxion ETF.  It had absolutely no reason (or justification) to address the VanEck/SolidX ETF. The fact it didn't do so is meaningless.
1021795231803559937 2018-07-24 12:32:21 EDT <jchervinsky> 5/ Today, the SEC extended its deadline to approve or deny the Direxion futures-backed bitcoin ETF by 60 days; the new deadline is September 21.

1021588501362397184 2018-07-23 22:50:53 EDT <devonArmistead> Entries in bitcoin address books should be extended pubkeys, such that each send is to the next fresh address. New xpub is shared with each contact. Abstract away addresses and instead send to recipients.  This makes bitcoin address books usable and adhere to best practices.
1021588500506759169 2018-07-23 22:50:53 EDT <devonArmistead> Address books in bitcoin are broken. They encourage address reuse, and if you _do_ use a new address every time then there's no reason for the address book in the first place. In latter case, better to tag tx, not address.  We can fix this...

1021137723174858752 2018-07-22 16:59:39 EDT <Beautyon_> When you ask the new generation of Austrian who is Computer Literate about Bitcoin, they answer questions directly and succinctly; they never evade, or resort to fallacies. Bitcoin is it's own answer. It works, and that's all that matters, not the annointing of some ‚Äúbig name‚Äù.

1021136434818945024 2018-07-22 16:54:32 EDT <Beautyon_> The new generation of Austrian Schoolers who've made the effort to become Computer Literate and who understand Bitcoin (and who have actually used it and are storing money in it) are not ignorant and blinded. They are more relevant, intelligent, and able to learn.
1021135392400125952 2018-07-22 16:50:23 EDT <Beautyon_> Don't expect the previous generation of Austrian School Economists to understand or accept Bitcoin.

In order for bitcoin to go down, people must be willing to buy it from sellers.  If everyone is looking at the same data, and a belief goes "viral", a liquidity vacuum appears.

1020240530154967042 2018-07-20 05:34:32 EDT <catgoggles> Alts bleeding while $BTC holding 7.4k. During the bear market, alt bleeds have often foreshadowed a downward move for $BTC. But in the bull market, bleeding was caused by $BTC dominance as everyone rode Bitcoin. The question is: is this foreshadowing or a dominance move?

I can create a WP-token, create $1 trillion, sell 1 token for $1 on an exchange and I'm a trillionaire with WP being the dominant coin.

1020079049429770240 2018-07-19 18:52:52 EDT <NickSzabo4> Neither was Bitcoin, but a series of fortunate governance events (disappearance of Satoshi, slide into irrelevance of Bitcoin Foundation, failure of various fork movements by hierarchical org leaders) made it much more resilient vs. centralization. Anti-hierarchy immune system.
1020077750781186061 2018-07-19 18:47:42 EDT <pierre_rochard> There's a fantasy of the price just going vertically up. This can't happen, too many traders chasing fiat profits or large holders rebalancing. For every panic buyer there's a "it's overvalued" non-buyer. For them it just doesn't matter how scalable, private, or usable bitcoin is
1020076732949368834 2018-07-19 18:43:39 EDT <pierre_rochard> If scaling, privacy, and usability were all entirely solved in Bitcoin, I think that would have a very marginal effect on Bitcoin's adoption / price. Adopting a new money just takes a lot of time, it's hard for people to go from "tulips" to "not going anywhere".

The closer the BTC short amount gets to the amount you spent on your altcoin the bigger the hedge. A 1:1 hedge would mean you're only making/losing money if your alt outperforms/underperforms BTC.

1017499097459195904 2018-07-12 16:01:03 EDT <Beautyon_> Bitcoin has a value that's extraordinary, in every sense. When the sea change in thinking comes, there will be no turning back and no denying what's happening. Some people may not like it, but they won't matter because they produce nothing of value.
1017498581358571520 2018-07-12 15:59:00 EDT <Beautyon_> A huge amount of fundamental innovation is happening on Bitcoin, and all of it is absolutely rock solid. These tools spreading out into user-land will cause Bitcoin to flow more quickly and frictionlessly. No other platform can claim this, especially the technical soundness.

1016185296998658048 2018-07-09 01:00:29 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> Bear markets and corrections often get confused. When #bitcoin went from under $1k to $20k in around 1 year a move back to $6.5k shouldn‚Äôt have surprised anyone. The correction will be done shortly and BTC will continue its upward trend. Nothing to see here folks.

Assets like Bitcoin don't need a government, military or police to back it since it has a natural value from being the best money the world has EVER seen as rated on tech properties.

1014052207207989248 2018-07-03 03:44:21 EDT <haydenotto_> The only selling point of Bitcoin Core today, is that it's apparently "a store of value". Core fanboys ignore the fact it lost 70% of this value in the last 6 months and maintain their claim. A prime example of cognitive dissonance.
1014050427795460097 2018-07-03 03:37:16 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> Ray Dalio quote applies nicely to #Bitcoin. "What you think is attainable is just a function of what you know at that moment." Most critics know very little about BTC. Seems to me there are very few actual BTC experts who are not bullish on BTC.
