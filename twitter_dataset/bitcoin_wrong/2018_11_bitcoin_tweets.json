Just how vulnerable price is to low liquidity.

1066477236419612672 2018-11-24 18:42:42 EDT <dollarsanddata> What amazes me is how much MORE adamant the Bitcoin experts get as the price falls.  Of course they may be right.

Bitcoin has no fundamental value. It has no other use than speculation, produces no cash flow. Good luck HODLing to zero.

1066233935410155520 2018-11-24 02:35:54 EDT <MichaelJordaan> Bitcoin has now dropped 78% from its all-time-high. Useful to know that it also dropped 94% in 2010, 94% in 2011, 85% from 2013 to 2015, and recovered strongly each time.
1066232471187009537 2018-11-24 02:30:05 EDT <Kecyy> Continuing on my investment advice  Be ready to buy Bitcoin once it hits $3200 range. I do know for sure that after that it is headed for over $20,000 in 2019  Also remember to buy Xrp as well.   Best wishes.

1066037454627467264 2018-11-23 13:35:09 EDT <DonAndrewBailey> It's fascinating to me how some proponents of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency "protocols" claim that TCP/IP had "market share competitors". Exactly what were those competitors? Framing them as competitors is really inappropriate and doesn't represent the history of development.

1065052950823911424 2018-11-20 20:23:05 EDT <APompliano> Bitcoin is down over 75% from its all-time high.  It is still the best performing asset class in the last 5 years.  It has dwarfed stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities since inception too.  Ignore the noise, trust the code.

Now the bigger worry should be a surprise deep re-org. Refusing to do an 11-deep re-org is reasonable and has nothing to do with centralization.

The discipline of Bitcoin is what will unleash the free market, and make absurd statements like Tim's moot.
1064483022970527744 2018-11-19 06:38:24 EDT <Beautyon_> Tim Cook is wrong about the free market "not working". Facebook and Twitter are not the "free market" they are companies operating in it, and are in no way representative of it.

Checkpoint system is basically centralised Proof-of-Node and is vulnerable to competing Proof-of-Node codebase. In other words, it is checkpoint botnets vs checkpoint botnets. That is NOT Bitcoin !

1063662772590919682 2018-11-17 00:19:01 EDT <AlexandraErin> BitCoin anarchists blow my mind.

You can't take it off the grid.
1063662564100448256 2018-11-17 00:18:11 EDT <AlexandraErin> With gold, at least, there was a slightly wider gap in the Underpants Gnome chart of how it was supposed to help you when society as we know it falls. where as with BitCoin there's not only no step 2, there's no step 3, either.
1063662223292334086 2018-11-17 00:16:50 EDT <AlexandraErin> The hype for BitCoin is almost indistinguishable from the hype for gold in the early 21st century.

1063244913276583936 2018-11-15 20:38:36 EDT <CryptoChoe> In my opinion, if #btc #bitcoin cannot break this .382 - .5 level, we're heading deeper in the next few days.  If we can, I do believe it will be the start of a 5 wave structure towards 5.8K - 6.0K.  In any case, I will be keeping my eyes set on .382 as the main inflection point.  pic.twitter.com/NYcoB9bHmv

History shows that movement in either direction is a good thing. It brings in new investors and media attention. Sooner or later we are going to see the bulls.
1063058771147137024 2018-11-15 08:18:56 EDT <francispouliot_> "Bitcoin is bad for the environment"   This is the new battleground our ennemies want to engage us on.  I see it shifting. Energy waste FUD is the perfect (only?) winning strategy to mobilize millenials against $BTC by framing it as an assault on peer-validated virtuous beliefs.

1063056500610887680 2018-11-15 08:09:55 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> 99% of people believe #bitcoin will never reach $1,000,000 but it's worth noting that it was not that long ago that 99% of people had never even heard of BTC. First there was the discovery stage, now we are in the awareness stage and next comes the widespread adoption stage.

1063055395369951233 2018-11-15 08:05:31 EDT <WhalePanda> I can already predict that no-coiners and fans of (D)PoS going to use this hashwar as an argument against Bitcoin's PoW. Just like the "Bitcoin is boiling the oceans" nonsensical argument.  A sustained hashwar attack on Bitcoin would be 15 times more expensive compared to $BCH.

1063037829209640960 2018-11-15 06:55:43 EDT <gaborgurbacs> The most interesting thing about this BCH fork to me, is that everyone from my company (a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù asset manager) knows enough details to talk about it. This fact alone has more value than any of the 2 chains. 2018 is a good year. Bitcoin and digital assets have come far.

Do you think those buyers waited just to sell it later?  Do you think those sellers chose to sell because they wanted to sell or had to sell?  Ask yourself unbiasedly.

1062506649188032512 2018-11-13 19:45:00 EDT <_JustinMoon_> IMO the best reason to learn to code isn't to "help bitcoin" directly.  The best reason is to make more money. To become more financially self-sovereign, and maybe buy a few more bitcoins while you can still afford them!
1062506320211800065 2018-11-13 19:43:41 EDT <allene418> Bitcoin is not scarce because Satoshi put the limit at 21 Million. Its value comes from much more than it's code.

1062128241446576128 2018-11-12 18:41:20 EDT <TheStalwart> What's funny is Bitcoin and Gold people actually do recognize that savings has costs. For one thing, there's volatility. But there's also storage costs, and the risks of losing one's private key, which is a de facto form of wealth degradation. They just don't connect the dots.
1062127587814715393 2018-11-12 18:38:44 EDT <MustStopMurad> there are no guarantees. there would still be taking risks in a world of the bitcoin standard just like there was risk in the world of the gold standard. But you eliminate money supply expansion risk, which is just theft/expropriation by another word.

1061978633412206593 2018-11-12 08:46:51 EDT <Ravencoin> Simple math: multiply everything in Bitcoin by 1000 and then adjust for one minute (instead of 10 minute) block times. This formula gives you the Ravencoin supply, block rewards etc. It also gives you an accurate measurement of distribution and network size compared to a known.
1061978229324636160 2018-11-12 08:45:15 EDT <JavierGonzalez> It's not the nuclear option. It is total defeat. It's starting to work on an altcoin.  The whitepaper says SHA-256.  And the project unable to survive in that algorithm by incompetent then IS NOT BITCOIN.
1061978055894294533 2018-11-12 08:44:33 EDT <Ravencoin> The fixed supply, halving schedule & issuance of Ravencoin is the same as Bitcoin other than two factors: 1) the primary accounting unit (one Ravencoin) is 1000x, so total supply is 21bn not 21mm 2) the issuance for halvings and block rewards are adjusted for one minute blocks

Because this space is so young, you don't have a track record of success you can use to judge people.  You have to rely on a combination of intuition and knowledge of first principles.

1061261180713533440 2018-11-10 09:15:57 EDT <MartyBent> Bitcoin presents an optionality that hasn‚Äôt existed in a long while.

1061248546077237253 2018-11-10 08:25:45 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> If #bitcoin dies crypto dies. If BTC thrives there will be some supportive roles for creative alts. So if you are promoting an alt while criticising BTC you are a fool.
1061246662352478208 2018-11-10 08:18:15 EDT <vires_numeris> They keep telling the same lies. "#Bitcoin cant scale, #BitcoinCash is not there yet!" #BCH just mined a full-blocksize cap 32MB block. And once again - it was not ViaBTC, nor BITMAIN, they are stuck at 8MB blocks. But exactly those small blockers refuse 128MB upgrade. Go figure. pic.twitter.com/EaPCRe69fD

1060938382686240768 2018-11-09 11:53:16 EDT <yassineARK> Towards the end of 2017, Bitcoin Cash's hash rate was neck and neck with Bitcoin's, briefly surpassing it. Today, Bitcoin's hash rate is 11x Bitcoin Cash's.  pic.twitter.com/z2L2mV8Y9Q
1060938381935423488 2018-11-09 11:53:16 EDT <yassineARK> I think we underestimate just how monstrous Bitcoin's hash power is compared to any other chain's.  5 hashes on Ethereum for every million hashes on Bitcoin. Same goes for Litecoin.

1060799661789929472 2018-11-09 02:42:02 EDT <lawmaster> After Craig Wright's meltdown yesterday, the price of Bitcoin Cash SV dropped by 50% in the last 24 hours. It is now trading for $53 (it was $104 yesterday). Meanwhile, price of Bitcoin Cash ABC increased by $18 even though BCH's price fell by $16. Cool to see markets work
1060799499176738816 2018-11-09 02:41:23 EDT <TweetyBirdbrain> The influential ppl (JW, RV, HY) that want to alter Bitcoin thru ABC, support other altcoins.   The influential ppl (Wright & Ayre) that do NOT want to alter Bitcoin thru SV, do NOT support any altcoins.   That is profound. SV is trying to protect Bitcoin #BCH, not attack it.

1060634133913890818 2018-11-08 15:44:17 EDT <misir_mahmudov> 18/ The way we talk about Bitcoin is important. The way we talk and introduce Bitcoin to people who have not yet been exposed to or who have been misinformed about Bitcoin is critical.

When the two armies met in the field of battle, the pragmatists fled from an adversary with conviction.

1060628378208878592 2018-11-08 15:21:25 EDT <pierre_rochard> Bitcoin is the idea that a decentralized p2p network of nodes will do a better job at making sound and credible monetary policy decisions than State central banks.  So far, it is an absolute success!
1060624586742599681 2018-11-08 15:06:21 EDT <NakamotoQuotes> The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin.

1060618441776918528 2018-11-08 14:41:56 EDT <brucefenton> True!  Same for ETFs!  These are not magical events that change fundamentals.

1060509856757501953 2018-11-08 07:30:27 EDT <woonomic> Tulips were never a store of value. The price bubble was over a futures contract for which traders never took settlement. Shorting was deemed illegal. It was 100% speculation.   Bitcoin users HODL with private keys. A tiny minority is traded on exchanges.   And yes, we can short.  pic.twitter.com/apLGIdGV6K
1060508835633278978 2018-11-08 07:26:24 EDT <woonomic> To add to this, assets that serve as store of value involve speculation. The main question to ask is how long it can store value for?

1059828649791311873 2018-11-06 10:23:35 EDT <jchervinsky> 16/ Consider the process that CME & CBOE went through to get approval for their bitcoin futures last year.  Both of them ended up self-certifying, but only after *months* of negotiations with the CFTC & changes to their products.  The CFTC explains here: ( https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7654-17¬†‚Ä¶)
1059828640878342144 2018-11-06 10:23:33 EDT <jchervinsky> 10/ In what seemed like a response to Caitlin's critiques, Bakkt's CEO, Kelly Loeffler, wrote a Medium post explaining that:  - all bitcoin trades on Bakkt will be fully prefunded, and - Bakkt will not use any leverage, commingling, or rehypothecation  https://medium.com/bakkt-blog/newhire-launch-c5dd55254566¬†‚Ä¶
1059828639540408320 2018-11-06 10:23:32 EDT <jchervinsky> 9/ Hype aside, some people have lingering concerns about Bakkt.  The big question is if Bakkt will try to financialize bitcoin in a harmful way, such as through the use of hidden leverage. The leading voice on this issue is @CaitlinLong_, who you must already be following by now.
1059828638420480003 2018-11-06 10:23:32 EDT <jchervinsky> 8/ In the minds of many, Bakkt's launch has become a full-fledged narrative for when & how the bear market will end.  It plays the same role as bitcoin ETFs as a trusted vehicle to bring that sweet institutional money into the space, but without all the trouble of SEC approval.
1059828637195780098 2018-11-06 10:23:32 EDT <jchervinsky> 7/ Phase two is a mystery. Bakkt hasn't said what it is or when it's coming.  Given all the talk about "spending" via Bakkt, I'm guessing it's some type of consumer-grade payment system. Maybe the kind you'd use at Starbucks to buy coffee with bitcoin. We'll have to wait and see.
1059828636121997312 2018-11-06 10:23:32 EDT <jchervinsky> 6/ Bakkt will roll out in two phases. Phase one, set for December 12, is a futures contract where one contract = one bitcoin.  This isn't too useful for commercial transactions--nobody buys stuff in increments of one bitcoin--but it's perfectly fine for institutional investors.

1059249094567301120 2018-11-04 20:00:38 EDT <francispouliot_> What makes Bitcoin unique is that it doesn't just detect when someone tries cheats: it also enforces the rules. This is why "blockchain tech" is a neat re-implementation of traditional crypto/security  (requires 3rd party enforcer), and why Bitcoin is a revolution (trustless).  https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1059227449232445440¬†‚Ä¶

1058665397619171329 2018-11-03 06:21:14 EDT <fluffypony> You and I both know that the best way to build a secure decentralised system is to start with first principles: use stuff that is proven, and demonstrably robust, and then build on that. Stuff like Lightning Network on top of Bitcoin does exactly that. Ethereum does not.
