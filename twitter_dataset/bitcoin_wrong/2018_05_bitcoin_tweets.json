1001140815400402944 2018-05-28 12:39:05 EDT <Crypto_Fugger> Not sure if people realise that if bitcoin delivers on its promise it will be the equivalent of a decentralised Manhatten project. By the people for the people. We may no longer need governments to drive massive developments for society.

1001139244566376448 2018-05-28 12:32:50 EDT <Noahpinion> The number of bitcoins is capped.  A BTC transaction costs more than a fiat transaction.  Thus, each bitcoin transaction neither increases the amount of usable currency, nor lowers transaction costs.  Thus, electricity spent on mining bitcoin seems like a waste of real resources.
1001138848867463169 2018-05-28 12:31:16 EDT <BitcoinMunger> Goldbugs never have a good argument on how gold will remerge as the money of the 21st century bc this would be moving backwards to needing trusted 3rdparties. #Bitcoin‚Äôs trustless network is superior & is made for the world we are headed towards - digital payments taking over.

International exchange is anarchic, and using Bitcoin allows contract governance by software instead of law.

Strongly believe we can reach $8.500 during June and then we have to see if we can break that critical area.   $BTC #bitcoin

1000881064942829568 2018-05-27 19:26:56 EDT <zbingledack> Bitcoin with blocksize scaling launched in 2009, kicked off the crypto revolution, worked amazingly well and attracted millions of people.

1000811260131270657 2018-05-27 14:49:33 EDT <Bitcoin> I think it's more likely that transactions dropped off as BTC became unusable in commerce and merchants started removing support for BTC payments.  The only use case left over is speculation.

1000499348575326208 2018-05-26 18:10:07 EDT <JoelKatz> I don't think it's unreasonable to describe XRP that Ripple holds in escrow as uncirculating supply. I would describe bitcoin that hasn't been mined yet much the same way. It can't be sold as a liquid asset, but we expect it to be part of the circulating supply in the future.

They know there's this thing called "blockchain" that somehow makes it decentralized, and they deduce that blockchain is some kind of general-purpose magic powder to make anything stronger, faster, cheaper.
998712656193257474 2018-05-21 19:50:27 EDT <MeniRosenfeld> 6/10 But these are things that might happen in *the future*. They're not things you can observe now. The only way to distinguish the two systems is to look at how they actually work. To be convinced of Bitcoin's merits, you need to know how it works, and why it is the way it is.
998712581899595776 2018-05-21 19:50:09 EDT <MeniRosenfeld> 4/10 But the benefits of Bitcoin over traditional currencies isn't anything you can so easily measure. Even without using any of Bitcoin's innovation, I can create a system that, to the end user, will appear indistinguishable from Bitcoin - greatly outperform it, in fact.

This is false, you just need to acquire 51% of the hash rate which is possible because of things called mining pools and then double spend.   Again, you are falsely claiming that this is a problem on $XRP ledger.

997022092112445440 2018-05-17 03:52:45 EDT <Beautyon_> In every way that matters Bitcoin is superior. Bitcoin is ethical, and bcash is unethical. Bitcoin is technically superior, has a bigger ecosystem of developers and applications and has a momentum that now cannot be stopped. Those refusing to accept reality are by definition MAD.

997021480742404096 2018-05-17 03:50:19 EDT <Beautyon_> Anyone who thinks bcash can beat Bitcoin is delusional. They don't understand what the word "exponential" means in math. In Bitcoin with Layer 2 software deployed, Bitcoin will become exponentially more powerful than any alt-coin, and that is on top of its dominant position.

997019375885369344 2018-05-17 03:41:57 EDT <OnWindowly> It's cute how developers & companies hide their switch to Bitcoin Cash by saying that they have decided to implement a variety of cryptocurrencies.

They are shadows of Bitcoin's history, that bcashers think if they replicate, will turn them in to Bitcoin. They are wrong, of course.
996832802132889601 2018-05-16 15:20:34 EDT <Beautyon_> No user cares about the block size of bcash. Ver thinks that everyone is concerned about it as he is, but they are not. All the users care about is convenience. Bitcoin and Lightning do everything any consumer needs AND they are technically sound, with many innovations to come.

996434302182350849 2018-05-15 12:57:05 EDT <jmcorgan> 23/ I expect that in five years all of these ‚Äúblockchain not bitcoin‚Äù companies will either go out of business, will have adapted their business model to work on top of Bitcoin, or will pivot away to something entirely unrelated to ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù.
996434300265488386 2018-05-15 12:57:04 EDT <jmcorgan> 22/ A blockchain is nothing more than an expensive and slow database.

995610271833120769 2018-05-13 06:22:41 EDT <saifedean> The problem with anything other than gold & bitcoin is that if the price goes up enough, from investment demand, more will be made & stock-to-flow will drop. Only gold & Bitcoin are immune to that which is why in a sound money economy a house is a consumption good, not investment
995610210898186241 2018-05-13 06:22:26 EDT <CryptoTutor> Note: if you trade altcoins with BTC and you're losing in Bitcoin value it simply means that holding Bitcoin would've been a better trade than trading altcoins. I'm pretty sure that many traders in the cryptomarket would‚Äôve been better off by just holding Bitcoin.

994680212024684545 2018-05-10 16:46:57 EDT <Beautyon_> Needless to say, this is HYPER BULLISH for Bitcoin; demand will go through the roof world-wide. Azteco is ready to supply Bitcoin to people in a form that is simple, has a flat learning curve, is non custodial and instant. Demand is going to go through the roof!
994679280713035779 2018-05-10 16:43:15 EDT <LucidInvestment> At the close today GBTC had a premium of 44% over the intrinsic value of the Trust's Bitcoin holdings. This about average for the past 4 years, but it is coming down. Below 20% becomes interesting. Remember, the premium shrinks when sentiment in Bitcoin weakens, and vice versa.
994679274434113536 2018-05-10 16:43:13 EDT <Beautyon_> There you have it.

993389788211265537 2018-05-07 03:19:16 EDT <Bitcoinlife2012> Most of the very wealthy have not yet bought #bitcoin. This is because they still don‚Äôt understand it so therefore see it as a risk.

993384510002626560 2018-05-07 02:58:18 EDT <_Kevin_Pham> Bitcoin is designed to protect humans from ourselves.  Humans can't resist the urge to get something from nothing by printing money (look at the ICO market).  That's why we outsourced the job to a machine (Bitcoin) no one person can control.

Only one output in each transaction is used to provide change back to the sender and often times even that isn't needed.  That's roughly 400,000..

The other returns to the original Bitcoin design but is now being called Bitcoin Cash because it is the road less traveled.  Image via @beijingbitcoins pic.twitter.com/OTgW2ymaYM
993051463499833345 2018-05-06 04:54:53 EDT <theantnest> Any real scientist interested in Bitcoin should be happy Bitcoin Cash exists.  It provides redundancy to the original chain, as well as allowing two simultaneous experiments to run.  This can only be rationally seen as a win for Bitcoin, doubling the chance of it succeeding.

992931205275254784 2018-05-05 20:57:01 EDT <peterktodd> There's probably more like dozens of ETH full nodes, not thousands; your numbers are more like the number of SPV nodes in Bitcoin.
992931024760786944 2018-05-05 20:56:18 EDT <peterktodd> See, ETH is an example of how this is complex: there are very few ETH nodes that are comparable to Bitcoin full nodes, because ETH takes huge shortcuts to get away from the fact that ETH is incredibly intensive to fully verify.

992170060440629248 2018-05-03 18:32:30 EDT <pierre_rochard> Bitcoin will be much greater in value than sum(fiat, gold). Its monetary policy is orders of magnitude superior - the effect that has on people‚Äôs marginal propensity to hold a balance can not be overstated. We‚Äôre getting a tiny glimpse of it with the virality of the HODL meme.

992166536013012992 2018-05-03 18:18:30 EDT <PeterRizun> The original design of Bitcoin (which exists today as BCH) facilitates massive scaling with SPV:   1/3: Users' wallets can track the longest proof-of-work chain consuming as little as 1 bit/sec of bandwidth (one could literally tap out the block headers in Morse code this fast.)

992153863430914048 2018-05-03 17:28:09 EDT <jratcliff> Anyone who claims their non-consensus hardfork 'is bitcoin' is not only lying but potentially committing financial fraud as well.  Anyone can spin up a hard-fork of bitcoin with minority hashpower and no consensus.  There is nothing special about BCH other than the fraud.
992153419568766976 2018-05-03 17:26:23 EDT <jratcliff> It just makes them a cheap knockoff.  BCH, nor any other fork, 'is bitcoin'.  Bitcoin is the continuous unbroken chain which has majority hashpower and consensus.  The one which has not suffered a non-consensus minority hashppower hard fork.  (cont.)

992152094894309376 2018-05-03 17:21:07 EDT <jratcliff> Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is in no way, shape, or form, 'bitcoin'.  Anyone who says it is, is lying and committing fraud.  BCH is a fork of the bitcoin source code.  It is no different than dozens of other incompatible software forks.  It's no different than litecoin, dogecoin, (cont)

992094195266408448 2018-05-03 13:31:03 EDT <parabolictrav> 4/ Calls for 2k, 3k etc (if they are using a bubble popping TA methodology) are only achievable IF Bitcoin had supply reaction. Since Bitcoin cannot have supply reaction, its parabolic trend will never be destroyed, it will only have periods of pause caused by impaired exchanges.
992094194125627394 2018-05-03 13:31:02 EDT <parabolictrav> 3/ Bitcoin has NO supply reaction. The difficulty increases ensure blocks remain around the 10 minute mark, and no unnatural increase in supply can happen. @saifedean outlines this beautifully in his book https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central-ebook/dp/B07BPM3GZQ¬†‚Ä¶

991939534194589696 2018-05-03 03:16:28 EDT <StevieZollo> tl;dr - Bitcoin must be built bottom-up, not top-down.  No one disagrees Bitcoin has potential to become a currency in the future. But the current real value is that of a secure, decentralised, censorship-resistant, unseizable form of sound money. The rest will follow. </thread>
991939530767745025 2018-05-03 03:16:28 EDT <StevieZollo> Once Bitcoin reaches the necessary level of liquidity and a big enough market cap, price volatility will naturally go down, making "medium of exchange" a much more viable application for it. This would make the economical point set above redundant (same point nocoiners use, btw).
