1122033700898840576 2019-04-27 03:04:15 EDT <adam3us> There are far more R&D resources on Bitcoin, maybe 100x or more, and world class contributors and teams massively outclassing forks, plus Bitcoin has vast network effect momentum so will IMO obsolete the scale trade-off faster than forks can sell adoption.

1120899765821067264 2019-04-23 23:58:24 EDT <zbingledack> Even BTC and BCH follow the altcoin paradigm: they assume the original Bitcoin protocol isn't capable, so they add stuff in an effort to make it capable.  Bitcoin SV is the only chain that operates by the reverse paradigm: removing the added cruft that was holding Bitcoin back.

1120897474921521152 2019-04-23 23:49:17 EDT <zbingledack> Bitcoin SV is the opposite of an altcoin.

As in everything, much of progress is in stopping doing the wrong thing.

1120092955317035009 2019-04-21 18:32:25 EDT <Bitcoin> Twitter is a privately owned platform and they have the legal right to shut down accounts for any reason. Being legal != being right.

Demand for hard money liquidity is infinitely larger than demand for low-security blockchain transactions, so shitcoins are useless for scaling.

I mean, I have a country and I have a religion....   Even if Bitcoin proves to be the most perfect form of money yet, it is still only money.

1119323345265352704 2019-04-19 15:34:16 EDT <jimmysong> People invested in altcoins and ICOs because they thought they could make money doing little to no work, i.e. rent-seeking. Their envy of Bitcoin is due to thinking that someone else got to rent-seek more profitably. These people have no clue and hence, lost a lot of money.

1118138005263351812 2019-04-16 09:04:09 EDT <Ravencoin> Many Bitcoin devs have probably not even heard of the project. A great thing about open source software is that anyone can experiment, use & build on it.    There have been 100s of operational Bitcoin forks.  Hopefully some work by Raven devs will someday help Bitcoin devs also.
1118138003782762496 2019-04-16 09:04:08 EDT <Ravencoin> Ravencoin has a different algo, purpose, mission, block time and different features from Bitcoin.  However, because it is a Bitcoin fork it benefits greatly from the massive amount of volunteer development, security & 2nd layer work done by many hard working bitcoin developers.üôè

What is it that Craig knows that they are all so afraid of?

This #DelistBSV attack is not over & will continue for a while to make pressure on weak hands holding BSV.  Continue to do your best & build what you already are in process of launching or achieving with Bitcoin BSV.  Business needs you.

1118012829347401728 2019-04-16 00:46:44 EDT <eric_lombrozo> IMHO, the main issue with listing Bitcoin forks is fraud and brand confusion.  If someone wants to smear feces on a canvas and sell it as art, and someone likes it and want to buy it, fine. But faking Picasso's signature and trying to pass it off as a Picasso is fraud.

Since then, the price rose 1,600% and is still up 350% from the 2013 peak, w/ more institutional involvement & high profile investors.  Any investor who doesn't own at least a little Bitcoin after 5 yrs has a mental block.

I think hard forks are a reasonable method of doing upgrades, especially in the near term while protocols are under development  Soft fork SegWit was ugly and added a lot of technical debt.

1115864946569613312 2019-04-10 02:31:49 EDT <VinnyLingham> The key indicator for the start of a sustainable bull run is likely a decoupling of asset values from Bitcoin (i.e. Bitcoin‚Äôs strength weakens other networks or vice versa). Anything else is just speculation again (maybe we need another bubble to learn more lessons? üòâüòÇ)...
1115864944426274816 2019-04-10 02:31:49 EDT <VinnyLingham> So, even if the Bitcoin network effect or store of value hypothesis results in an increased price, this currently translates into broader market based upon sentiment, not fundamentals. So in practice, other cryptos get a boost from any improvements in Bitcoin fundamentals today.
1115864943394471937 2019-04-10 02:31:48 EDT <VinnyLingham> It‚Äôs easy to argue that Bitcoin can be worth $10k or $20k, or even $100k, but the problem is that as the price has been rising towards those levels, we‚Äôre not seeing Bitcoin dominance increase disproportionately.

Bitcoin had no scaling problem before. Satoshi says right in WP just raise blocksize. Moore's law takes care of the rest.  Core Devs paid by Blockstream. Go figure.

1113697295789199360 2019-04-04 02:58:21 EDT <newsbtc> Bitcoin Price Analysis by @AayushJs: BTC moved into a strong uptrend above the $5,000 price mark & is facing crucial resistance near $5,240. There are chances of more upsides towards the $5,500 or $5,750 level.

1113697124305309696 2019-04-04 02:57:40 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> Bitcoin investors are required to keep buying new Bitcoins, to pay for the network's running costs (a.k.a. "securitising the network"). This tax on Bitcoin investors (currently around $5 million / day) is mandatory. If investors don't buy enough new Bitcoins, $BTC price plunges.

An $80 million sell wall (as reported by @Bleeding_Crypto) was absorbed at $4,200. Curious to see where this leads the crypto market.
