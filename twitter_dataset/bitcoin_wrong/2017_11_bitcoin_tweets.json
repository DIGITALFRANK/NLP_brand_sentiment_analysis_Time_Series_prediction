935248080869277696 2017-11-27 15:44:53 EDT <SatoshiLite> John @BitcoinErrorLog is right in saying that Bitcoin is not peer to peer. The original Bitcoin was! It had the ability to send BTC to a specific IP address. The blockchain was used to prevent double spends. Satoshi later removed it after realizing it wasn't used much and useful.
935247543922868224 2017-11-27 15:42:45 EDT <_Kevin_Pham> Reminder for all the crypto SJWs that complain about the Bitcoin community being toxic:  Before we had Bitcoin, wars that killed millions of people determined reserve currency status.  A bunch of nerds teasing eachother on the internet is utopia in comparison.
935247486716751872 2017-11-27 15:42:31 EDT <SatoshiLite> People appealing to the Bitcoin white paper are those that don't really understand how Bitcoin works today. Satoshi is brilliant and wrote the amazing Bitcoin white paper. But Bitcoin today is very different than the white paper.

934635838989676544 2017-11-25 23:12:03 EDT <Silver_Watchdog> The Evolution of Bitcoin  1. It's the future of global payments. The revolution! 2. So what about Mt.Gox and robo traders. Stocks are rigged too. 3. Yes it forks and creates more supply. Your point? 4. Everyone knows it's all traded for speculation and not used for payments. Geez

You have disqualified these people from using Bitcoin because of an elitist attitude that says those people are unnecessary. This is an autocratic mindset that is quite frankly, a dangerous worldview.

For example, the move from $3,000 to $4,000 required a 33% move. From $9,000 to $10,000 only requires 11%. From $20,000 to $21,000 ... 5% ... etcetera. #bitcoin $50,000 is not that far away.

932364352342102017 2017-11-19 16:45:58 EDT <LukeDashjr> So I am forced to change my mind: miners do in fact control IF a hardfork will happen (albeit not necessarily the details of said HF). Simply because apparently without miners shutting down Bitcoin completely, the community won't come to consensus for even security improvements.
932364230925438976 2017-11-19 16:45:29 EDT <LukeDashjr> Regardless of confusion on poll wording, it seems clear there's still notable opposition to a PoW change, and as it is a hardfork, none can be done at the moment, even despite Bitcoin's somewhat desperate need for it.  https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/929647172659896322¬†‚Ä¶
