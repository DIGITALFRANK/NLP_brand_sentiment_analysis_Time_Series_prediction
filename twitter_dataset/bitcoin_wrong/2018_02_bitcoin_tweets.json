967231579855532038 2018-02-23 21:55:53 EDT <VinnyLingham> Back to the original tweet for this thread. The crypto community lives on the belief that there won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúrun on the bank‚Äù and that market participants will only convert to fiat as & when they need fiat. This is ironically in stark contrast to why Bitcoin was born in 2008!
967231566232502274 2018-02-23 21:55:50 EDT <VinnyLingham> Bitcoin was designed as a system to take on the big banks and fractional reserve system. What I‚Äôm seeing now is that a large number of funded crypto projects are only holding crypto and their runways are fluctuating every day.

You're going into synthetic USD, it's the same as selling to your neighbor for X amount of money + being able to rebuy back.

964865510352433153 2018-02-17 09:13:58 EDT <kallewoof> The bcash scam sometimes scares me. "What if it gets momentum and the majority thinks it's the real bitcoin?" But then I realize, it doesn't matter. Even if it is so successful it manages to fool so many that bcash > btc in price, it's only temporary. A scam is a scam after all.

964819145614295041 2018-02-17 06:09:44 EDT <Beautyon_> The crazy idea that Bitcoin is money has spawned bad models; ATMs, Coinbase, KYC/AML to name but three. The true innovations, like MultiSig, use only Bitcoin and are software only. They are nimble like OpenDime and Azteco. If you embrace Bitcoin's nature, your product wins.

964551148370907136 2018-02-16 12:24:48 EDT <Beautyon_> This bad thinking is called "Bitcoin Skeuomorphism"; designing products and interfaces that mimic money functions.

964511029496549376 2018-02-16 09:45:23 EDT <Beautyon_> You fix this by using graphic design that is more in line with Bitcoin's nature. Not only will you start to convey the correct subliminal messaging, but your corporate identity, workflows and overall design will be distinct, making you a market leader in every way.
964510604613619713 2018-02-16 09:43:42 EDT <Beautyon_> Bitcoin is not money. It has more in common with instant messaging than it does with money. The graphic design language of banking is not only inappropriate, but it spreads and reinforces the wrong idea that financial regulation is applicable to Bitcoin. How to fix this?

963801463020498945 2018-02-14 10:45:50 EDT <Beautyon_> It is not possible for you to be a Bitcoiner and a Multicoiner at the same time, and obviously you can't be for Bitcoin and for bcash at the same time. A true understanding of Bitcoin means you must exclude both of those because they are both totally irrational.
963800987923337216 2018-02-14 10:43:56 EDT <Beautyon_> It is clear now, that many early advocates for Bitcoin were only saying the correct things about it by chance. Their narratives did not adapt to the reality of the software; that is why they are now bcashers and multicoiners; they never understood Bitcoin in the first place.

963115543589920769 2018-02-12 13:20:14 EDT <timbray> 12/ I don‚Äôt know anyone really technically credible, who is not building/selling blockchain/bitcoin, who is still a believer in either.
963115538074382336 2018-02-12 13:20:12 EDT <timbray> 6/ Governments try to protect their less-clueful citizens from self-injury incurred by dangerous driving, patent medicines, and Ponzi schemes. Time to get serious about Bitcoin.
963115537185124353 2018-02-12 13:20:12 EDT <timbray> 5/ Right now, the Bitcoin miners, and long-term holders (like me), are selling into the inrushing wave of suckers, who will be left holding ephemeral digital vapor.
963115536195338240 2018-02-12 13:20:12 EDT <timbray> 4/ Anybody who bought into Bitcoin any time after mid-2017 and hasn‚Äôt already sold is probably going to lose their money.
963115535390031872 2018-02-12 13:20:12 EDT <timbray> 3/ Bitcoin is just not fast and efficient enough to be used as a currency. Also, Bitcoins do not exhibit beauty, or tell stories, or have any of the other aspects that give intangible objects value.
963115534475714560 2018-02-12 13:20:11 EDT <timbray> 2/ First, Bitcoin. The technology is a fantastic engineering achievement. But, a Bitcoin is a thing that costs several thousand dollars in capex and opex to create, and then can‚Äôt be used for anything.

962708500219543552 2018-02-11 10:22:47 EDT <JeremyRubin> Bitcoin addresses have some quantum resistance if HODL forever because the curve point is hashed. To remain secure you would have to make a q resistant way to sign with a proof of knowing the public key other than opening the hash commitment.

Dump them while you can and reinvest into Bitcoin, which has great dev-team and future uses.

961051054870876165 2018-02-06 20:36:41 EDT <Beautyon_> It took years for the entertainment industry to respond with iTunes and Netflix. They succeeded not by trying to kill piracy, but by creating an ecosystem that completely satisfied the needs of the market. This cannot happen in Bitcoin; because money is not made in the market.
961050483388542976 2018-02-06 20:34:25 EDT <Beautyon_> Banning Bitcoin is not possible. The MPA/RIAA and similar bodies have tried over decades to prevent and stop people copying music and movies, and they failed. Now, instead of movies, it is money that is turned into freely flowing data that cannot be stopped or detected.

Bitcoin value: $7000  Upfront payment: $3400  Bitcoin mined per day: $12.50  $12.50 * 365 = $4562  But you only get 50% of that = $2281  In the first year, you've paid $3400 and will get $2281  Good for Kodak, not you.

960827748028620800 2018-02-06 05:49:21 EDT <JoelKatz> You're comparing a short-term DoS attack to people actually having their bitcoin transactions reversed as if these two things were remotely comparable. I'd much rather take a system that doesn't make unsafe forward progress than one that is unstoppable but can go backwards. 2/2
960827557095514112 2018-02-06 05:48:35 EDT <JoelKatz> The failure to make forward progress when it's unsafe to do so and the inability to make backward progress are huge pluses, not minuses as you are pretending. If two companies are malicious, bitcoin goes backwards. And the validators can be changed, bitcoin has no clear fix. 1/2

960764080649678848 2018-02-06 01:36:21 EDT <JoelKatz> And that's all that matters because if you're vulnerable to a double spend, making forward progress is unsafe. It is way better *NOT* to make forward progress if making forward progress is unsafe. Bitcoin making forward progress with 51% malicious hashing is BAD.

960763068115374082 2018-02-06 01:32:20 EDT <JoelKatz> It's clearly much worse that bitcoin allows the honest 49% to go on as if nothing is wrong here because they're vulnerable to monetary harm at any time. Ripple's failure to make forward progress in this condition -- where forward progress is unsafe -- is a huge plus.
960762663587336192 2018-02-06 01:30:43 EDT <JoelKatz> Are you seriously going to hang your argument on the bitcoin network not being shut down if 51% of hashing power is in the hands of malicious entities bent on harming the network?!

960630703892455430 2018-02-05 16:46:22 EDT <crypto_sarah9> If you are in loss in your altcoins, hodl now.

So, don't sell in loss, don't buy any other altcoins if you are already all in.

959393191568044032 2018-02-02 06:48:56 EDT <Reuters> JUST IN: Bitcoin slides below $8,000 on Bitstamp exchange for first time since November, down 11 percent on day  pic.twitter.com/ctjEpecCGR
959393102602661888 2018-02-02 06:48:34 EDT <chijs> Bitcoin is down 15% today and it‚Äôs actually one of the best performers in the crypto market. It shows it‚Äôs the most resilient coin out there and will be the first one to bounce back.

959392204585390080 2018-02-02 06:45:00 EDT <PeterSchiff> #Bitcoin just broke below $8,000, down 60% from its $20,000 high hit less than 2 months ago.  The good news for Bitcoin owners is that the price can only drop by $1,000 per day for another 8 days!   So relax, keep HODLING, and ignore all the FUD!

If these drops killed it, how do all the rebounds not make you question your premises, @nouriel and @paulkrugman?
959368903725060096 2018-02-02 05:12:25 EDT <saifedean> Nocoiners like @nouriel or @paulkrugman could be taken seriously if they'd have the balls to specify an actual price above which they'd admit Bitcoin succeeded. Otherwise, their hysterical gloating over price drops is just childish bitterness acting out.
