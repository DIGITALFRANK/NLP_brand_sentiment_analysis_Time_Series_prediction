1112137531871551489 2019-03-30 19:40:24 EDT <davthewave> The only time you use the linear scale with Bitcoin is when you are charting mass adoption [and the so-called S-curve]. For the y axis is then linear - divided by 100 percentiles representing the population.  Subsequent cycles are so pronounced that even the S curve is distorted  pic.twitter.com/m1IMlJwQXr
1112132137996742659 2019-03-30 19:18:58 EDT <mikerelentless> I laugh everytime I see tweets about lightning network.  LN is the biggest hoax in crypto!!  Clearly.  Worse than Bitconnect.  It won't be long now before everyone sees lightning network for what it really is.  A trick to divert people away from using Bitcoin.  #Bitcoin
1112131484423471109 2019-03-30 19:16:22 EDT <jimmysong> The financial system is a cocoon of rent seeking. Safe and comfortable in their own bubble, they think their exploitation of everyone else is theirs by divine right.  Bitcoin is the frontier. It's your way out of financial slavery to the elites.

1111757470664257538 2019-03-29 18:30:11 EDT <tedmrogers> 2/ "Staying close" to #bitcoin basically means putting yourself through an auto-didactic PhD program in which you go deep on tech, economics, philosophy, history, politics, etc., etc.. Sounds tough but it's so interesting that it rarely feels like work.
1111755903680679936 2019-03-29 18:23:57 EDT <tedmrogers> 1/ It’s not enough to “understand” #bitcoin.  If you don’t stay close to it, you become vulnerable to superficial noise and make stupid, short-sighted decisions.  You become pro-cyclical and buy-high and sell-low.

And the whole point of Bitcoin is to not be gameable.

1111391510598045701 2019-03-28 18:15:59 EDT <jimmysong> ICOs are easy, building products, hard. Blockchain talk is easy, creating value, hard. Features are easy, security, hard. Trust is easy, verification, hard. Fiat is easy, Bitcoin, hard.

1111390631291609088 2019-03-28 18:12:29 EDT <CobraBitcoin> We are so small. The biggest tweets in Bitcoin Twitter get somewhere around 2000-4000 likes. Want perspective? Go look at even niche minor online celebrities and you’ll routinely see 20,000+ likes. There are YouTube channels with more subscribers than there are Bitcoin users.
1111390629735481345 2019-03-28 18:12:29 EDT <CobraBitcoin> How many people got burned by buying Bitcoin at $19k because y’all told them to buy and hodl and convinced them it would keep rising while you had “$250k/BTC” in your profile names? Many OGs dumped massively at those prices and bought back lower while publicly being bullish.
1111390628087136257 2019-03-28 18:12:29 EDT <CobraBitcoin> Bitcoin actually *can* change the world, but only if it’s community is humble, kind, and wins people over through honestly explaining the risks and the use cases Bitcoin is most well suited for. Not to promise them riches and brainwash them.
1111389896923451392 2019-03-28 18:09:34 EDT <CryptosBatman> If we break the resistance we will see #Bitcoin back at $6000 and the bear market will finally be over!

1111347597980196865 2019-03-28 15:21:29 EDT <MagicPoopCannon> I see some discussions about bitcoin vs. gold as a "safe haven." Although I love both, gold is heavy and not easily concealable. Bitcoin, is invisible, weightless, increasingly private, and unconfiscatable. I would much rather store wealth in BTC for those and other reasons.

1110537950335516677 2019-03-26 09:44:14 EDT <AttilaAros> You broke the chronological ordering for transactions with Bitcoin Cash. No longer a distributed timestamp server.   No longer Bitcoin.  You can put a domain on it. You can even put a Twitter account on it.   But it's not Bitcoin to anyone with understanding of the whitepaper.

1110291793017491457 2019-03-25 17:26:06 EDT <Moon__Rekt> Bitcoin's inevitable adoption is far too obvious.   Currently it requires a little imagination/open-mindedness to see, but it won't long until the entire world sees Bitcoin for what it truly is:   the greatest and final evolution of money
1110291310588715009 2019-03-25 17:24:11 EDT <KennethBosak> I spent / lost more money than I made at this point, traveling and advocating for Bitcoin and blockchain.

1110291237683249153 2019-03-25 17:23:53 EDT <BitcoinZAR> Holding is a way of using bitcoin, it's not doing nothing. Holding helps price go up. High price means more news and people excited to join,  more holders, more people earning, spending etc., & therefore helps mass adoption. Holding helps towards mass adoption more than spending.

1110171234447302656 2019-03-25 09:27:02 EDT <KBryanW> Dude if a coin can "flippen" bitcoin, then there's no such thing as digital scarcity and store of value.  If you held a coin, you would have to look over your shoulder to make sure your coin won't be flippened.  Multicoinism can't work. If it does, it's the end of the experiment.

1109897164631826432 2019-03-24 15:17:59 EDT <hodlonaut> That’s a list of people who have done their damndest to destroy Bitcoin, over several years. All of them completely discredited. I wouldn’t have them on, and they don’t deserve a platform. Scum.   I understand people get pissed. I don’t think @PeterMcCormack has bad intentions.

1109894798977220608 2019-03-24 15:08:35 EDT <_unwriter> It's NOT about the transport.  The point is, files no longer contain IP/domain references to a cloud server. They are Bitcoin native.  Instead of  http://bitcoinfiles.org  or  http://bico.media  or  http://bitpaste.app , a single URI powered by Bitcoin txid and content hash.
1109894794455728128 2019-03-24 15:08:34 EDT <_unwriter> Many people seem to misunderstand the point of B://, C://, and Bottle.  The point about Bottle is it lets to publish and consume things natively on Bitcoin through transport-independent schemes.

1109808323044536322 2019-03-24 09:24:58 EDT <saifedean> This isn't to say Bitcoin is guaranteed to rise. It can fail, or demand could disappear for many reasons. It could crash 90% from here & not recover in 20 years. Betting serious money on something so volatile is stupid & dangerous. If you do it, don't blame me!

1109688961184735232 2019-03-24 01:30:40 EDT <WahkersRevolt> “No taxes or regulations”  “Private charities can replace welfare”  “There were LESS regulations and taxes following WWII than now”  “Bitcoin can replace the centralized banking system”  Is this an alt-right philosopher or a 13-year-old on 4chan?
1109687756752592899 2019-03-24 01:25:52 EDT <renepickhardt> This article by @100trillionUSD creates quite some nice models and is a really nice #DataAnalytics #DataScience work  https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25 … it uses stock / flow metric by @saifedean to predict Bitcoin price as  0.4 * SF ^ 3  Means every halving there's a min x8 increase in value
1109686497777725440 2019-03-24 01:20:52 EDT <rallyqt> I’ve been dabbling in the $tron network. $TRX is fast sending/receiving. It makes bitcoin look like a damn dinosaur. The DApps are nice.   BTC ultimate first mover, SOV, and decentralized merits. But there’s more space for other cryptos, obviously.   Let the market decide.  https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/1109520069191782400 …
1109685824289980416 2019-03-24 01:18:12 EDT <StopAndDecrypt> How is this anything but a disingenuous misrepresentation of Luke's words?  Luke simply doesn't consider one to be using Bitcoin unless they run a full-node, and he's constantly trying to argue it should be easier to do.  He's literally the most proactive person on this subject.  pic.twitter.com/jzmkwI4rn2

1109641115546849285 2019-03-23 22:20:32 EDT <jimmysong> The real benefit of Bitcoin isn't even the monetary rewards. The real benefit is how it changes you from a consumerist, high time preference immaturity to a low time preference maturity. Character is worth even more than money.
1109640276388298753 2019-03-23 22:17:12 EDT <hasufl> A successful Bitcoin is a serious competitor for people's savings. Much abuse can be prevented just by offering an exit when it is most needed.  It's one of the few trends in the world today that promise to benefit the individual and not the collective.   That is what's at stake.

And there are "blockchain developers" who will only work on Bitcoin in a self-directed / autonomous manner.   Important to recognize that this whole ecosystem runs on open source software.

1108237632776089601 2019-03-20 01:23:36 EDT <DanielKrawisz> In order to predict the price of Bitcoin, you need to think about the kinds of economic activities other people will offer in the future in exchange for Bitcoin. You also need to think about how well other people buying and selling Bitcoin actually understand Bitcoin.

1107496085793189888 2019-03-18 00:16:57 EDT <TheBitfi> Fiat money is used because gold is a scarce resource & economies growing quickly can’t mine enough to back their currency supply requirements.

In the end, one is signal and the other is signaling.

What going to happen if there are “better” alternatives? “We’re in the early stages” narrative is not going to last much longer. #XRP is commercially deployed through the use of #xRapid — B safe new #crypto fans! https://twitter.com/XRP_VETERAN/status/1085523046675464192 …
1107392185643618304 2019-03-17 17:24:06 EDT <PandaofBinance> Don't understand why would anyone take #CBOE discontinuing #Bitcoin $BTC futrues as a bad thing  Institutions suppress volatility. BTC is far better off with its market cycles without the Wall Street interference  An asset driven by retail is the easiest asset to trade

1107385830232866816 2019-03-17 16:58:50 EDT <_ConnerBrown_> True confidence is quiet.   There’s a reason why Bitcoin doesn’t need sponsorships and giveaways.
1107379297440792576 2019-03-17 16:32:53 EDT <swifteagle8> For the first time ever, there is a money whose scarcity will equal that of time.   I believe people will eventually realize the importance of this and start storing their time in bitcoin.   If not, you give government the ability to steal your most scarce asset  #stackingsats
1107379293221457922 2019-03-17 16:32:52 EDT <swifteagle8> We convert time into money through work.  Money = stored time.   We trade our most scarce asset for something less scarce.   Scarcity can be measured through stock to flow ratio (inverse of inflation)  USD: 20:1 Gold: 50:1  Bitcoin: ~25:1 but trending towards infinite

Targets in red! ($5300 and $70000). Keep in mind this doesn't remove the bear market, but its a good start.  pic.twitter.com/w0tGFEA0Nx

1106767758254112770 2019-03-16 00:02:50 EDT <NakamotoQuotes> The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin.

1106701598775013377 2019-03-15 19:39:57 EDT <francispouliot_> IMO for that there should be a bitcoin-wallet-specific shamir implementation that is standardized to ensure users have tools to recover in the future
1106701113779208192 2019-03-15 19:38:01 EDT <francispouliot_> Bitcoin wallets should let users choose to backup their mnemonic seed directly in Shamir Shared Secret format. The seed would never be exposed visually. Wallets can check user wrote it down by asking for one of the secrets. Users don't need to enter seed in other device/software.

1106242260314644481 2019-03-14 13:14:42 EDT <hugohanoi> IMO Bitcoin the technology CANNOT be separated from Bitcoin the currency. Because at its heart 1/3 of the system depends on the ingenious incentive scheme which is denominated in Bitcoin‘s _native token_. If the currency aspect (1/3) fails, the tech (2/3) fails (and vice versa).  https://twitter.com/eric_lombrozo/status/1106116088360828928 …
1106242165640962054 2019-03-14 13:14:19 EDT <AaronvanW> This binary interpretation of "money" -- the euro is "money"; bitcoin is "not money" -- is a meaningless exercise in semantics. In the real world there is no clear distinction, and people will use as money whatever works best.  Snippet from Hayek's The Denationalization of Money:  pic.twitter.com/J1oZyHnVD3

1106064379831820288 2019-03-14 01:27:52 EDT <NakamotoQuotes> The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin.

1105912890870108160 2019-03-13 15:25:54 EDT <LucasNuzzi> 11\ Ultimately, the long-term demand for privacy through these types of transaction directly translates into an increase in on-chain transaction fees. As such, demand for privacy can be an instrumental way to develop Bitcoin's fee market after the last bitcoin has been mined.
1105912886210252800 2019-03-13 15:25:53 EDT <LucasNuzzi> 5\ Apart from the requirement of a HF, a problem with these technologies is that they can prevent the full audibility of Bitcoin’s monetary base. In other words, when transaction values are encoded, it becomes difficult to verify whether Bitcoin’s supply cap is, in fact, 21M BTC.

1105901595043065857 2019-03-13 14:41:01 EDT <PeterRizun> ANSWER: (A) Bob needs 1000 coins of liquidity in order to get paid for the tickets.  This is one way LN may feel very weird to users.

1105426785611771909 2019-03-12 07:14:18 EDT <cointradernik> Does it not then make sense that, irrespective of what Bitcoin does over the next ~3 months, it is likely that we get a cyclical shift in altcoins to capitalise on this scenario?
1105426782054961152 2019-03-12 07:14:17 EDT <cointradernik> These greater profits mean more BTC that can be held for when Bitcoin begins a new bull cycle; ultimately being sold out into USD when BTC becomes expensive again.  That is the ideal scenario for anyone manipulating altcoin markets.

1105424317947494402 2019-03-12 07:04:29 EDT <eyeone> Bitcoin is a machine. It needs continuous incentives to run further. It can't afford to stop, otherwise it might go running backwards. And this is by design.  Orphans and Reorgs are features,  not bugs.

1105377235878510592 2019-03-12 03:57:24 EDT <LukeDashjr> The Bitcoin term "full node" is short for "fully validating node". It refers only to the level of validation, not to what is being stored.  The term for a node that stores the history, is "archive node".
1105373686733787136 2019-03-12 03:43:18 EDT <BitcoinErrorLog> The Lightning Network separates the benefits of centralized payment services from the trust & custody requirements. If you can grok that, you can build a new paradigm of Bitcoin businesses.

Blockstream has control of the protocol, no investment in BTC and no interest in scaling. They will ride it all the way to the bottom.

It cannot be corrupted, and there is no one there to bail out banks, governments or anyone else. You can't create it to fund warfare or infrastructure. It imposes even handed, unbreakable discipline on everyone.

1104863856906637313 2019-03-10 17:57:25 EDT <giacomozucco> I really hope this will not pass in Core, and that if it does people will move to a better implementation without it. Incentivizing people for not running Bitcoin nodes is the worst thing to be done now.
1104863104502886400 2019-03-10 17:54:26 EDT <_ConnerBrown_> “In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak; but for that one must have long legs.

All Americans will receive 2 satoshis for each block mined.  This will bootstrap cleaner energy and sound money.

1104605579350167552 2019-03-09 23:51:07 EDT <balajis> One of the many great things about crypto is that anyone can now do empirical, large scale, opt-in experiments in macroeconomics. Bitcoin proved that a deflationary reserve currency is indeed viable. Many other experiments are being run today. And everyone involved has  opted in.

1102820457470816257 2019-03-05 01:37:41 EDT <LN_Master_Hub> People world wide are taking notice, and are stocking up on Bitcoin, to get their piece of the pie before 'the masses' realize how important it is. At most, only 21M ppl worldwide can have a whole bitcoin. If you have one, you're in the top .2% ownership of hard money.
1102820451196133377 2019-03-05 01:37:39 EDT <AltcoinDailyio> Hey @starbuckshelp, looking for a little more detail on your @Bakkt partnership. When will I be able to spend some bitcoin on your delicious coffee?
1102818231486541825 2019-03-05 01:28:50 EDT <LN_Master_Hub> It's funny how people say #BTC is a "Bear market".  That might be true... if it were zero supply like a fixed stock.  But it's not.  In the last 12 months approx 657,000 new #Bitcoin. To maintain $3500 bottom for 12 months, that takes $2.3 BILLION of *NEW* investment.
1102815909268332544 2019-03-05 01:19:36 EDT <vegardwikeby> It seems reason, logic & calmness has started to grow the longer I go into the rabbit hole of #BitcoinSV  I don't think I'm alone with this feeling, this sense of maturity in knowing what Bitcoin actually means, to be in an environment where excitement is not based on feelings.

1102808359583997952 2019-03-05 00:49:36 EDT <bitcoin_whales> The vast majority of people I know, doesn’t want to buy $BTC at current levels of $3k to $4k.

This single act will forever prevent negative news article from appearing in any publication.

1102394131098320896 2019-03-03 21:23:37 EDT <pyskell> It's really sad to see people be as wrong about Lightning and DAI as they were about Bitcoin.  Don't be so salty both of these things are quite promising experimental tech.

1102388517764820992 2019-03-03 21:01:18 EDT <JackMallers> 4/ The force of Bitcoin overcomes all language barriers, government restrictions, public shaming, social attacks, and corporate enemies. It is something you don’t truly understand until you see it, use it and interact with it.
1102388508830900224 2019-03-03 21:01:16 EDT <JackMallers> 3/ Bitcoin is not software that is lacking consumer adoption, an app that is not meeting performance benchmarks, or a business that needs a change in leadership. Bitcoin is a global phenomenon. An idea and a movement that represents a more connected and free world.
1102388505358024709 2019-03-03 21:01:15 EDT <JackMallers> 2/ Bitcoin is the worlds first global language. All of us don’t natively speak the same language, eat the same food, enjoy the same hobbies, but we all gravitate to projects like Bitcoin, Lightning, and Zap because they represent a better world.
1102387881287606272 2019-03-03 20:58:46 EDT <nic__carter> Bitcoin is money for enemies. Andrew Torba and Jack Dorsey both like Bitcoin. You can't stop people you dislike using a pseudonymous and censor-resistant protocol.

1102382969325527040 2019-03-03 20:39:15 EDT <Moon__Rekt> The fact that Bitcoin is a global phenomenon (Japan, South Korea, Europe, US, Venezuela, Africa) with no clear “leader” or “marketing team” shows that there are clear incentives for Bitcoin to spread naturally across the world.

1102139107692695552 2019-03-03 04:30:14 EDT <Ziya_Sadr> I'd love to see: @wikileaks @Snowden hold the torch at one point.  People who help with privacy on bitcoin like @nopara73 and @SamouraiWallet.  or a Bitcoiner from Israel/North Korea will be great choices to take the torch next from Iran (through an intermediary).
1102139106019168256 2019-03-03 04:30:14 EDT <Ziya_Sadr> We here in Iran constantly face brutal Bans from foreign services (money confiscated, broken businesses, denied access or services). I've never had a transaction pass the borders of Iran until bitcoin came to existence. bitcoin now empowers us to get connected back to the world.
1102139104182059009 2019-03-03 04:30:13 EDT <Ziya_Sadr> We have always been censored from both sides, Sanctioned globally, and censored locally by our own gov. #Bitcoin will lead the way in censorship resistance and I'll pass the torch to other people who help the world resist censorship!
1102136506075045888 2019-03-03 04:19:54 EDT <giacomozucco> If we were expecting nation states to allow or to enforce hard money, we would not need a state-resistant alternative like Bitcoin in the first place. The incentives for the regulator are all towards supply manipulation & censorship, so this trend is hardly surprising.
1102135757484027904 2019-03-03 04:16:55 EDT <hodlonaut> Bitcoin will continue building bridges between people around the world.

1101551618275897344 2019-03-01 13:35:46 EDT <francispouliot_> When you put your skin in the Bitcoin game by becoming a Bitcoin hodler, the success of Bitcoin becomes a life priority for you. It is a unique bond which unites millions of people who have never met one another. Their interests and ressource allocation spontaneously converges.
1101551263739797505 2019-03-01 13:34:21 EDT <francispouliot_> The secret of Bitcoin's success is that never in history has there been a project in which so many people have commited not only their skin, but their soul as well.  The failure of Bitcoin would be a catastrophic life-shattering event.  They cannot and will not let that happen.

1101358209648910336 2019-03-01 00:47:14 EDT <Excellion> Liquidity will improve with time but Lightning is never going to be used for very large payments. You would just go send on chain. In the future, a Bitcoin wallet will automatically just send on or off chain based on amount & capacity. It will just work.
1101354007715491840 2019-03-01 00:30:32 EDT <_Kevin_Pham> Short-sighted developers don't see the unintended consequences of changing Bitcoin's economics.  Limiting the block size reduces transaction fees which reduces security which opens the door to increasing inflation to pay miners.  BSV is the real store of value Bitcoin.
1101351258999275520 2019-03-01 00:19:36 EDT <Blockchain_Jay> I think it’s safe to suggest Bitcoin will go lower, but I would say the prospects for the future of Bitcoin are incredibly strong as Digital Gold. Therefore no matter the currrent price, I feel Bitcoin is undervalued at $3,800 per coin.
1101350748548284416 2019-03-01 00:17:35 EDT <FaceLikeTheSun> Some folks (analysts) are suggesting we’re about to see a potentially more than 50% crash in the stock market and an explosion in gold/silver and Bitcoin.   How many of you think this is actually happening in 2019?
