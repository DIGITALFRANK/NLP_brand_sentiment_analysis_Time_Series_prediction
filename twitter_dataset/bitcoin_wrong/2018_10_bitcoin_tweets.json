1057395427400732672 2018-10-30 18:14:50 EDT <JorgeStolfi> Bitcoin mining currently consumes 7 GW of electricity, which is 7 typical nuclear reactors or a large hydro dam.

1057110992637677568 2018-10-29 23:24:35 EDT <dstadulis> In the critic’s world, an USD-IOU coin (marketed as a “stable coin”) should be more valuable than bitcoin because it has more “real-word backing” when the converse is true; it is less valuable because there’s redemption-default risk. TTP are value-destabilizing holes @NickSzabo4

1056640644326846465 2018-10-28 16:15:35 EDT <TheVladCostea> In his @CryptoInsiderHQ interview, @giacomozucco has also addressed the meaning behind the term "Bitcoin Maximalist" and its economic implications in relation to both the financial system & the crypto industry.

1056633435245162498 2018-10-28 15:46:56 EDT <mattblaze> Before you say “bitcoin”, I thought so too, a long time ago. (I even chaired the financial crypto conference). But it got hijacked by scammers and consumed by volatility that has rendered it useless for its intended purpose. This is hard.
1056630445767569410 2018-10-28 15:35:04 EDT <alexbosworth> More than 3 years ago the story people were telling about Bitcoin was "‘You know, guys, if we don’t do this, Bitcoin will be dead in 4 years."  https://www.technologyreview.com/s/540921/the-looming-problem-that-could-kill-bitcoin/ … Today the story is that it's progressing so fast you need to start paying attention or be left behind next year.
1056628866389704704 2018-10-28 15:28:47 EDT <_Kevin_Pham> The ultimate goal of Bitcoin is to enfranchise 7.5 billion people economically.  The ultimate goal of the Dollar is to disenfranchise 7.15 billion so .35 billion people can live like royalty.

1056598612149444608 2018-10-28 13:28:34 EDT <Dave_Jonez_02> What a masterpiece.   I think everyone is forever grateful to Satoshi for bringing distributed payment systems to the masses, but David Schwartz has really pushed it's evolution and has been carrying the torch onwards.  Bitcoin made history, XRP is it's first successor.
1056597216360624130 2018-10-28 13:23:01 EDT <jeetsidhu_> 1/ Running a Bitcoin full node is important for removing the need to trust third parties (that can be co-opted or defect against the network). Full nodes are not "non-economic miners". Keeping full nodes cheap is important for maintaining Bitcoin's decentralization.
1056596861727981569 2018-10-28 13:21:37 EDT <Nicholas_Merten> One thing that people are ignoring in this quiet market is the fact that, as of tomorrow, Bitcoin will have held $6,000 for over a year. That’s huge. It’s proving that bitcoin is functioning as a store of value.

1056575341748137984 2018-10-28 11:56:06 EDT <maxkeiser> FDS (Fiat Derangement Syndrome) is real. It drives people like @Nouriel and @paulkrugman loony. Fiat is the currency of death and destruction. #Bitcoin is the currency of free trade and peace. Scratch the surface of a BTC-hater and you’ll find a violent, war-monger.
1056572853632434176 2018-10-28 11:46:13 EDT <maxkeiser> #Bitcoin is hard (non-depreciating) money, it attracts principled, peaceful advocates.

1056192195211022336 2018-10-27 10:33:37 EDT <adam3us> so at today's Bitcoin power density J/Kg, the whole blockchain weighs 30kg of antimatter. but historically the coins were produced with less power, so following @pwuille days destroyed, it would weigh 1.1kg. but in practice heavier because earlier miners were less efficient.

1056188001011879936 2018-10-27 10:16:57 EDT <adam3us> actually we can calculate a weight for a 220GJ bitcoin, as its energy used, via E=mc^2 and then we get 1BTC weighs 2.4mg. so 2.4mg of antimatter = 1BTC at 220GJ/BTC, since antimatter has 100% mass/energy conversion.

1056168278228455424 2018-10-27 08:58:34 EDT <CobraBitcoin> There is a DANGEROUS trend towards centralisation in the crypto community, especially in Bitcoin. Blockstream promotes centralized sidechain “Liquid”, exchanges push various centralised “stablecoins”, BITMAIN pushes centralized “Wormhole”; it’s all BULLSHIT to undermine Bitcoin.

1055998363429101568 2018-10-26 21:43:23 EDT <NickSzabo4> I will say this tho in this CEO's favor: at least he knows that Bitcoin is currency not a retail payment rail & bitcoin-on-Visa makes far more sense than a cryptocurrency's main blockchain trying to compete directly w/Visa. In that sense he is far ahead of most in this space.

1055975528056963073 2018-10-26 20:12:39 EDT <eric_lombrozo> I don't really care if it's Bitcoin or something else that defeats this. But it has to be defeated. And so far, there aren't too many serious alternatives.
1055971666885595146 2018-10-26 19:57:19 EDT <XrpBoy> If #Bitcoin is such a great store of value, why did it tank from $20K? What’s that ?! Institutional investors won’t do the same? Oh ok👌...

Ripple is a holder of XRP, as am I. What they do with their crypto is none of my business. Just like what I do with mine is none of yours. Deal with it.
1055963621665062912 2018-10-26 19:25:20 EDT <Steven_McKie> ETH doesn’t have to overtake bitcoin’s marketcap if it can share its liquidity by tokenizing and pegging assets. Overtime, the mechanisms will become less centralized, and both assets will be more resilient because of it.

1055961042470100992 2018-10-26 19:15:05 EDT <Steven_McKie> Lol at bitcoin OGs that don’t get the point of stablecoins as a bridge for the next wave of adoption (decentralized stablecoins and the more centralized ones). As long as they can interact and trade for other non-centralized assets, it’s a win.

1054789802766217218 2018-10-23 13:41:00 EDT <bitstein> And before you say, "How could Bitcoin be stable? The price is so volatile!"…  Bitcoin has the perfect monetary policy.

1054789427686330369 2018-10-23 13:39:31 EDT <bitstein> "Stablecoin" used to refer to cryptocurrencies that use external price data on a basket of goods to algorithmically attain a "stable" price. Now apparently it just means "USD money substitute."  The next step is to use a stable currency, i.e. Bitcoin, in reserves instead.

1054130457636421638 2018-10-21 18:01:00 EDT <vinarmani> Bitcoin is a paradigm shift. That new paradigm WILL become "world money."  However, what we understand "Bitcoin" to be, in 2018, WILL NOT be what eventually gains mass adoption.  It is myopic to believe that your beloved ticker symbol and associated network will be "wolrd money."

1054077852201705472 2018-10-21 14:31:58 EDT <coinjunky> Bitcoin is the most underpriced asset on the planet right now. Any dip is a gift, anyone selling their bitcoin after holding them so long here is doing so emotionally and likely in hopes of acquiring more lower. It is a time based trap, a game of chicken. Good luck.
1054077421157199873 2018-10-21 14:30:15 EDT <timevalueofbtc> Some have been quick to dismiss my writing because “LN fees will be close to zero.” But the game changer is non-zero fees, leading to observable time value of bitcoin.

1054077286897586177 2018-10-21 14:29:43 EDT <coinjunky> I believe some day soon bitcoin will have a liquidity crisis.

1054046507605876742 2018-10-21 12:27:25 EDT <Dogetoshi> You can be bullish on Bitcoin but not on Tether. Why is that so hard to understand?  If/when Tether collapses, Bitcoin will most likely survive.
1054045393816670208 2018-10-21 12:22:59 EDT <theonevortex> Some people complain that #bitcoin is not yet ready for people earning under $2/day.   What these people don't understand is that bitcoin is here to compete/provide exit from the systems that cause the conditions that result in people earning only $2/day in the 1st place.

1054039063370625024 2018-10-21 11:57:50 EDT <saifedean> It may also have to do with regrets over unhodling.

Watching them appreciate is not easy to stomach, so they lash out at hodlers for being right all along. Many such cases!

1053937728809771009 2018-10-21 05:15:10 EDT <olivierjanss> Bitcoin (BTC) has now been abandoned by almost everyone that was there at the start that helped make it great. Blockstream/Core has destroyed BTC’s community and whitepaper. Most people left now are those who destroyed it, so it’s now an irrational, competition hating niche cult.
1053937268036132864 2018-10-21 05:13:20 EDT <AndrewEDavis> If $BTC keeps moving sideways / within that 6440-6405 (yellow box) range (#BitMex), for the next 8-20 hours, there's a good chance that it drops.  #Bitcoin's best scenario to avoid dropping, would be to get over 6445, and hold above that price for 4hrs+ (within the next ~20 hrs).  pic.twitter.com/lqhHCyBTyH

Seeing absolutely no traction on this, and it's our greatest area of opportunity.  Until then, Bitcoin Cash, like BTC, is a digital tracking cookie for one's finances.

1053921228061372416 2018-10-21 04:09:36 EDT <cryptospaced> Feels like a decent time to move some gains into BTC and put that into cold storage. Bitcoin has been quiet lately, which I'm sure won't last. I'd rather pull back some alt exposure until the next macro setup is clearer.

Until people begin to ask themselves, "What is Bitcoin Cash? And how is it different from Bitcoin?" We need Bitcoin Cash to enter the common lexicon.

1053605203663052801 2018-10-20 07:13:50 EDT <leashless> Bitcoin is still undervalued.  It's a political organisation with no leaders that makes many of its activists rich, and able to keep working to promote bitcoin.  As an incentive alignment tool bitcoin is better than any innovation since the invention of the corporation. Remember.

BTC will trade at this range for few months. It needs to find stability before another bull run.. #bitcoin #crypto

1053557743041331200 2018-10-20 04:05:14 EDT <MustStopMurad> False. Gold was a non-government ordained money for millenia. For most of history money was chosen by the market, not decreed by the state. No, fiat can't exist, it will continuously "leak" value to Bitcoin. Strong money devalues the weak. Governments cannot stop it.

Ultimately, though, it’s not going to be enough and we will have to continue to build support for L2 scaling systems, both those existing and those in the future.

1053195226804899840 2018-10-19 04:04:44 EDT <Beautyon_> Bitcoin isn't about “governance”, Foundations, interfering with software developers or spending hours permuting words to come up with impossible use cases. That's what these people do because they refuse to face problems head on and deal with Bitcoin directly.
1053194349025157120 2018-10-19 04:01:14 EDT <Beautyon_> Before you can teach, you need to have studied; you can't teach what you don't understand. This is 100% pure altcoinism.

1053139432822304768 2018-10-19 00:23:01 EDT <JoelKatz> The bitcoin hard fork is much more complex because the choice of a winning chain creates winners and losers. Bitcoin had no clear leader at that time and stakeholders had no problem coming together. So, again, feels like FUD or concern trolling to me.
1053138633245347840 2018-10-19 00:19:51 EDT <JoelKatz> A benevolent dictator who makes good decisions that most participants voluntarily follow has proven to be a good, workable solution to this problem. Bitcoin doesn't have one right now.
1053138133246652416 2018-10-19 00:17:51 EDT <JoelKatz> A good example was bitcoin's unintentional hard fork in 2013.

1053109440378011648 2018-10-18 22:23:51 EDT <JamesGRickards> It doesn't mean much to say "crypto space." You have to be more specific. If you're investing in distributed ledger technology firms, that could make sense. If you're buying bitcoin, that's a waste.

1052532525023805440 2018-10-17 08:11:23 EDT <TheDesertLynx> Things usually have more nuance than one-sentence strong points, but in this case I can't deny it.

1052531515027087360 2018-10-17 08:07:22 EDT <Socratezonline> The more I think about it, the more I realize that bitcoin was never meant to be anti-government or anti-banking.  It is anti-debasing of the monetary system. It is sound money. That alone will have many implications towards the existing power structure.  Exit Keynesianism.  #BCH

1052526381328998400 2018-10-17 07:46:58 EDT <hodlonaut> Bitcoin, or any other project that carries the same profound promise of change, is worth fighting for. This is not toxic maximalism. This is standing up for truth in a jungle of lies, hype and bad actors.
1052526299724611584 2018-10-17 07:46:39 EDT <mir_btc> A friend who has recently lost the brother in a car accident told me she knows he owned bitcoin but it seems impossible to get them back.

1052525380081397760 2018-10-17 07:43:00 EDT <davidgerard> Bitcoiners will complain if you point out that per transaction, the existing system does ridiculously better on energy, as apparently that's a bad measure  so: let us replace bitcoin with one (1) sun-bleached dog turd  it will use MUCH less power, and only do 7 tps less work
1052524679494156293 2018-10-17 07:40:13 EDT <hodlonaut> The only reason I am a Bitcoin mostimalist/maximalist is that Bitcoin is the only project that is actually decentralized. I'm not clinging to anything, but what Bitcoin has already done and become is very beautiful and profoundly different from any other project.
1052520155476045824 2018-10-17 07:22:14 EDT <MrHodl> Bitcoin is the only game in town.   Deal with it.
1052519523750838273 2018-10-17 07:19:43 EDT <AaronvanW> I do, and I think Bitcoin Maximalism is consistent and viable.  Bitcoin Maximalism _would_ be a problematic idea if it somehow prevented non-Maximalists from using Bitcoin. But it doesn't.

1052516223274115075 2018-10-17 07:06:37 EDT <giacomozucco> No, nocoinerism doesn't. It is one extreme ("something like Bitcoin cannot exist"). The opposite extreme is multicoinism ("something like Bitcoin can be replicated infinite times, & by the way you should buy my version of it"). Bitcoin Maximalism is the balanced middle ground.

Bitcoin has a chance but shitcoins don't. Imagine a shitcoin even sustaining the S2X attack last year. Unthinkable.

1052345955876577280 2018-10-16 19:50:02 EDT <francispouliot_> Bitcoin Maximalism is about what will happen (descriptive) and why it's good (prescriptive).  It's very much in favor of currency competition. It merely proposes that a single winner will emerge dominant (good: coexisting monies = pyramid scheme) and it's a bet Bitcoin will win.

1052308985569718272 2018-10-16 17:23:07 EDT <fluffypony> Thus, I conclude that the most likely outcome is either EVERYTHING fails, or Bitcoin and a handful of well-designed, non-scammy, useful cryptocurrencies succeed.
1052308548330373120 2018-10-16 17:21:23 EDT <fluffypony> I believe in three things: 1. Bitcoin cannot fail while altcoins survive, Bitcoin must succeed for any altcoin to also succeed 2. Bitcoin cannot succeed while every altcoin fails and disappears 3. Most altcoins will fail, because most of them are scams (accidental or otherwise)
1052306679893815298 2018-10-16 17:13:58 EDT <loomdart> Truth is, Banks can at best have symbiotic relations with bitcoin. This benefits them the most. Bitcoin can also have a parasitic relationship with banks. What can't happen is banks obtaining a long-term parasitic relationship with bitcoin. This is why I'm ok with ETFs and bakkt.

1052139151636611072 2018-10-16 06:08:16 EDT <melikmanukyan> People are missing the point—it was never about decentralization, decentralization is only a means to an end.  The only thing that truly matters in this space is the free movement of 21M #Bitcoin.  Decentralization allows us to realize this goal.

1052072701463023616 2018-10-16 01:44:13 EDT <saifedean> Attempting to restrict financial freedoms to restrict the growth of bitcoin will create more demand for bitcoin as uncensorable money, which in turn finances a growing infrastructure to get around any restrictions to its use.
1052072263489650688 2018-10-16 01:42:28 EDT <saifedean> A lot of the technical discussion about how to destroy Bitcoin ignores the economic incentive to produce & use things like @gotenna & @SamouraiWallet. If people value Bitcoin, they'll pay for ways to connect to it. Shutting one avenue just makes another more profitable.
1052072148074987522 2018-10-16 01:42:01 EDT <AnselLindner> IMO one of the biggest threats to bitcoin, is regulated stablecoins in the banks' control. Tether is their first target.

It's an open platform and a query protocol to easily build any web/mobile app using bitcoin as backend by turning it into a db. With a db you can build ANYTHING.  The question is no longer "what is possible?". It is "what should I build today?"

1051801761231622144 2018-10-15 07:47:36 EDT <RussLamberti> Regarding monetary tech, Bitcoin's claim is audacious: that it can be neither destroyed (as other digital currency attempts were) NOR co-opted (as private bank money/currency was). I currently *think* these claims are valid. If so, states will have to try another line of attack.

Rather, we will just witness some short term drama.  If mtgox with 80% of the trading volume didn’t, why should Tether be the end of the world.

1051788396878843904 2018-10-15 06:54:29 EDT <LucidInvestment> The story today is not the upward blip in cryptos and Bitcoin. It is the unraveling of Tether. In 2007 money market funds in the US “broke the buck” (traded below 1$). This started financial crisis. This is what Tether did last night.
1051787270372675586 2018-10-15 06:50:01 EDT <LucidInvestment> Bitcoin prices surged on a short squeeze. The short squeeze apparently began with Tether imploding. Traders bought Bitcoin to exit Tether. Is squeeze over? Too early to tell. No change on my price outlook for Bitcoin.

1051742205529022464 2018-10-15 03:50:56 EDT <CryptoTutor> Summary of the past hours:  1- Tether is down ~8% in USD value, what makes major exchange BTCUSDT charts look very bullish (Bitfinex/Binance).  2- Bitcoin is in fact up ~230 USD since yesterday (Bitmex/Bitstamp).  3- As a result, many are very bullish bc of point 1
1051741253845602304 2018-10-15 03:47:09 EDT <IvanOnTech> Part of the confusion comes from the fact that Bitfinex calls Tether USD and not USDT. The reason the BTC price is so much higher on Bitfinex is because the price is in USDT, beware! #bitcoin  pic.twitter.com/C6Ejka8hu7

1051578890081239041 2018-10-14 17:01:59 EDT <TuurDemeester> "The algo can change" => IMO the likelihood that an economic consensus of Bitcoin stakeholders would embrace a hard-fork leading to higher dilution is as small as the chance that a global consensus of gold bugs would accept same-weight-silver-payouts for gold liabilities.

1051466751215628288 2018-10-14 09:36:23 EDT <andrewgdotcom> But bitcoin could be shuttered tomorrow and nobody but the hodlers would even notice. That’s the difference.
1051466062833885184 2018-10-14 09:33:39 EDT <andrewgdotcom> If the US and EU treated Bitcoin as a money laundering scheme (which it is) and forbade the banks and credit card companies from doing business with bitcoin exchanges, it would collapse overnight.
1051465355540000768 2018-10-14 09:30:50 EDT <andrewgdotcom> Then bitcoin would use 50,000% of today’s TOTAL electricity production capacity, and would process payments a thousand times more slowly. The notion that current banking systems are “inefficient” is a flat out lie.

1051460750617837569 2018-10-14 09:12:32 EDT <RedditBTC> Nouriel Roubini has always been talking sh*t about Bitcoin. And he's always wrong.  https://ift.tt/2EkFWG6 
1051460441715560448 2018-10-14 09:11:19 EDT <Andy_Hoffman_CG> If I'm reading this correctly, he has made his FIRST #BTC TRADE, after years of claiming he'd never trade #Bitcoin...and more importantly, that'd he'd NEVER short it, because it's "too dangerous." Price has moved up since this Tweet, and I can't wait to see what happens next.  https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/1051134612112633857 …
1051460386489331713 2018-10-14 09:11:05 EDT <Nouriel> So the cost per transaction of bitcoin is literally $60. So if I were to buy a $3 latte at Starbucks I would have to pay $63 to get it!  So the myth of a "Brilliant new technology that reduces the vast fees of legacy financial systems"! turns out to be a Big Fat Lie!  https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/1051458999760146432 …

If the price goes up, they have to pay more.  The bond never gets redeemed. If you want out, you need to find a buyer.  Interested?  The bond is called Bitcoin.

1051101941491802112 2018-10-13 09:26:46 EDT <stephendpalley> Bitcoin is no more or less ideological than, say, secure multiparty computation, or for that matter centralized database tech.  The narrative is ideological and has been grabbed by some of the people you've  described.  But it doesn't have to be.
1051101038416207877 2018-10-13 09:23:10 EDT <stephendpalley> Programmable p2p money that solves for double spend isn't ideological one way or the other. It's useful. That the bitcoin narrative has been coopted by ideologues, naive hangers on & fraudsters is beyond dispute. I wouldn't throw out the baby w/ the bathwater though.

1050731879886811136 2018-10-12 08:56:16 EDT <Excellion> Bitcoin is trustless and permissionless. Corrrect! Liquid sits on top of Bitcoin and uses a distributed trust model. If you're a trader (remember what Liquid is for) you trust the exchange with custody of your coins while trading - so now you trust a federation of exchanges.

1050642562065657856 2018-10-12 03:01:21 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> At a price of $6k, Bitcoin burns $10M per day in electricity. At $20k, as difficulty adjusts, it would burn $30M per day. No gains in productivity or cheaper electricity can change this - it’s a market equilibrium. Branding this as “rewards” instead of “fees” won’t save you.

1050575164008615936 2018-10-11 22:33:32 EDT <justicemate> Selling Bitcoin creates a downward pressure on price.

1050574985159430146 2018-10-11 22:32:49 EDT <jchervinsky> 19/ I understand that's what the senators wanted to hear, and maybe it's technically true at this moment.  But there's no doubt privacy is coming to bitcoin soon. It's already here for coins like Monero & many people think it's crucial. What would the senators think about that?
1050574983729172480 2018-10-11 22:32:49 EDT <jchervinsky> 18/ Second (and more troubling) was Peter's answer about law enforcement.  He said bitcoin doesn't help criminals because the blockchain is public & every transaction can be tracked. He said there isn't really such thing as anonymity so the senators shouldn't worry about crime.
1050574976607240193 2018-10-11 22:32:47 EDT <jchervinsky> 13/ To give credit where it's due, Sen. Toomey had good & meaningful questions about how the tech works. He asked if bitcoin can scale past five tx/s & whether "mining oligopolies" matter. It seemed like he gets it.  This is the quality of discussion we need to see from Congress.

1050560091886358533 2018-10-11 21:33:39 EDT <pierre_rochard> Bitcoin was technically not a premine, Satoshi announced two months ahead, he manually created the unspendable genesis block, and he released the software when he started mining not after. Also, keep in mind that the price was $0.00 at the time, so Satoshi mined at a loss

1050537993499340800 2018-10-11 20:05:50 EDT <maximollusk> One of my favorite things about Bitcoin is the more expensive it gets the more miners will secure the network. If $BTC was worth $1,000,000.00 the network will automatically up its security spending to around $650,000,000,000.00 per year.

1050471615753060353 2018-10-11 15:42:04 EDT <olivierjanss> How long will it take before Blockstream’s “Liquid Bitcoin” L-BTC user wallet is created? Near-instant confirmations, low / no fees,... Nothing like the crippled Bitcoin mainchain that suffers high fees, big delays, etc. All of the above created and brought to you by Blockstream!

Venezuela's "Petro" ICO nonsense is only the beginning. We'll see more rampant scamming from government officials.

1050353864887689216 2018-10-11 07:54:10 EDT <pierre_rochard> Nouriel Roubini’s tweets are getting surprisingly little positive engagement from USD maximalists and anticoiners. Few seem to care enough to defend State seigniorage. This does not bode well for govt monies. Bitcoin will easily replace them at this rate.

1050325771590520833 2018-10-11 06:02:32 EDT <olivierjanss> Blockstream, the company mainly responsible for crippling Bitcoin, releases “Liquid sidechains” today. No surprise, it’s a completely centralized and uncreative dated solution only supported by 1 notable exchange, which has already been in bed with Blockstream forever (Bitfinex).
1050325107900633088 2018-10-11 05:59:54 EDT <TheStalwart> To the extent that Bitcoin has "safe haven" properties, those won't emerge in traditional market volatility. But rather some other crisis (probably political) where people perceive the need to transact in a decentralized manner.
1050318982434062337 2018-10-11 05:35:34 EDT <IncomeSharks> When #Bitcoin finds it bottom, it's usually more profitable to ride Alt Coins back up as the percentage they fell are much higher.

1050036339473813504 2018-10-10 10:52:26 EDT <saifedean> Don't take my word for it. Whatever energy Bitcoin consumes is the price people are willing to pay to get around government controlled central banks. Don't like it? Vote for better central bankers! Good luck, this will surely work a charm in your democracy.
1050035652685754368 2018-10-10 10:49:42 EDT <PdqJones> To fully comprehend the long-term potential of Bitcoin, it's vital to understand the concept of "social scalability" as put forward by @NickSzabo4.

1050033808546951172 2018-10-10 10:42:23 EDT <saifedean> Bitcoin is competing with central banks and will end up consuming infinitely more energy than central banks. And that's a good thing because Bitcoin is infinitely better than government central banks and their financing of Keynesian insanity, wars, and inflation.

1050020774097108994 2018-10-10 09:50:35 EDT <DeaterBob> Gold is too easily manipulated by a paper market because there is no real threat of a call for physical delivery.  Bitcoin does not have this problem.  Bitcoin is too easily deliverable for a paper market to manipulate the price.  Bring on Wall Street!!!

1050019156559613952 2018-10-10 09:44:09 EDT <pierre_rochard> bitcoins belong in the “growth currency” asset class.

Important to understand where Bitcoin’s high growth has historically come from and its future sustainability.

1049755689432899586 2018-10-09 16:17:14 EDT <Beautyon_> If you want to make an objection to Bitcoin, it needs to be done in the language of Bitcoin: Software. Writing a piece of prose to attack Bitcoin, after nine years of flawless operation is pointless. All prose is good for is explaining it's effects, not attacking its operation.
1049755258061246466 2018-10-09 16:15:31 EDT <ReformedBroker> Bitcoin at $6,000 seems bottom-y.

1049753823529619463 2018-10-09 16:09:49 EDT <saifedean> Government moneys have spineless worthless careerist academics. Shitcoins have slick slimy PR operations. Bitcoin has geniuses volunteering their time to spreading truth & exposing lies, like @StopAndDeCrypto. His previous account got banned & this new one is a mandatory follow!
1049752660503609345 2018-10-09 16:05:12 EDT <Beautyon_> This is exactly right. People who complain about "the end of cash" are in fact campaigning to entrench a fraudulent system of fake money, not real cash. Rather than go backwards to a gold standard, Bitcoin takes everyone forward past fiat and gold to "super sound money".
1049751354258862080 2018-10-09 16:00:00 EDT <JWWeatherman_> #Bitcoin is the greatest opportunity to acquire wealth in the history of mankind IMO. We are still very early here.

1049707936979869697 2018-10-09 13:07:29 EDT <BittBurger> So nearly all of the leaders in the Bitcoin Core (#BTC) space have now told people to just use Banking, Fiat, and Credit Cards instead of #Bitcoin.  Its tempting to assume they've been bought off by Banks, but more likely they're just *that* unqualified to be running the project.

1049371034485510149 2018-10-08 14:48:45 EDT <yassineARK> 10/ So what does this mean for Bitcoin? This means that existing network infrastructure does not need to be in place for nodes to interact. TxTenna will enable off-grid broadcasts of signed Bitcoin transactions from @SamouraiWallet. This is huge.

1049237156848447488 2018-10-08 05:56:46 EDT <sassycrass> No matter how much I learn of Bitcoin, I still have trouble grasping the core concept. I believe that's because my mind gets distracted by the human evil. Best I got is "digital answer to the Krugerrand. Useful for purchasing large-scale arms, unicorn meat, and slaves."

1049006031882280960 2018-10-07 14:38:22 EDT <wsculley> Same is true for cryptocurrencies.  For example, embedded in Bitcoin is a monetary policy that creates a conflict of interest between miners/operators (who want to maximize fees) and users (who want to minimize them).  Bitcoin isn't broken; but it isn't neutral either.

1048999695413137410 2018-10-07 14:13:11 EDT <tokenpay> It depends if it becomes regulated (or if regulations are enforced) as issuing an ERC-20 token really appears to be an unregistered security while the “sale” of a Bitcoin-based coin with its own blockchain is like selling baseball cards. Blockchain coins have inherent utility.

Fragmented data, processing, security, liquidity, incentives. LN fails at game theory. Bitcoin is game theory. LN is unbitcoin.

1048885492291391489 2018-10-07 06:39:23 EDT <Tr0llyTr0llFace> “Bitcoin is backed by math” is absolute bullshit. There’s a mathematical proof that you can’t be 100% sure that a piece of code is bug-free. Therefore you can’t have 100% decentralised, censorship resistant money that relies on computer code. And THAT’s backed by math.

1048881978479730690 2018-10-07 06:25:25 EDT <giacomozucco> Bitcoin Maximalism is not the thesis that altcoin shouldn't exist, or even make money to some people. It's the thesis that, just like any other Ponzi scheme, they cannot individually be sustainable in the long run.

1048879635306561536 2018-10-07 06:16:06 EDT <Nicholas_Merten> Many don’t know, but it’s likely you’ve heard of bitcoin thanks to the millions Roger has spent advertising bitcoin. So even if you think he’s misleading people on BCH being the “real” bitcoin, his track record proves he’s been a massive positive for bitcoin and crypto overall.
1048879629514285056 2018-10-07 06:16:05 EDT <Nicholas_Merten> Here me out. First, not everything’s black and white. Hate bitcoin cash all you want, but Roger has done more good for this space than 99.99% of people. Since 2011, he’s been driven by its potential for freeing people rather than making millions (P2P digital cash > speculation).

1048786054210310144 2018-10-07 00:04:15 EDT <MajinSatoshi> First, you can’t build a “better Bitcoin”. Second, your project is a knockoff of $Burst, which btw is 4-years old and going through massive improvements since last year. Instead on working on that, a fully open source protocol, you want to reinvent the wheel. Good luck with that.

1048016877933551616 2018-10-04 21:07:49 EDT <pierre_rochard> For me, it's about the monetary economics, not the innovation. If a coin doesn't have the soundness, credibility, and legitimacy of Bitcoin's monetary policy - it's a shitcoin. Yes, that covers everything from Litecoin to Dentacoin to the USD. Yes, it is an offensive word!

1047523814752448512 2018-10-03 12:28:34 EDT <wheatpond> Bitcoin is for everyone: vegans, carnivores, Americans, Venezuelans, Chinese people, programmers, designers, housekeepers, rightists, left-wingers, kids, senior citizens.. and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
1047522133885247494 2018-10-03 12:21:53 EDT <arjunblj> This is a misunderstanding of PoW. Right now, about 3-4% of Bitcoin's market cap is spent securing it.  There's no reason to believe this spend scales ~proportionately as Bitcoin grows, as the threshold for electricity spend/ASICs needed would be surpassed.

Bitcoin Core (BTC), though, is fraudently advertized as P2P Cash. In reality, it changed to casino chips for Wallstreet to milk inexperienced retail investors.

This is what happens when you can’t withdraw real money from an exchange.   You have to buy Bitcoin to remove it & that creates a premium. Get all your money off Tether exchanges.

1046952245164531712 2018-10-01 22:37:21 EDT <CryptoQF> Low volume doesn’t automatically mean lack of interest. In fact with Bitcoin it more likely signals balance between bulls and bears. Bulls afraid to buy, bears afraid to sell. A move up gets bulls excited and bears more room. Vice versa a move down. This price is no mans zone.

1046739534778707970 2018-10-01 08:32:07 EDT <bytemaster7> Satoshi’s vision of a trustless politics free currency died when hash power voting was adopted to change rules.  A true politics free system has immutable rules.  #bitcoin and #ethereum are mutable protocols and are more prone to collusion of the unelected Chinese than #eos.

1046720512951558144 2018-10-01 07:16:32 EDT <Trader_M4tt> Observations I've made:  Current retail sentiment around Bitcoin looks to be at a yearly low  Fundamentals at their best they've been  Next to no BTC charts on here. More people trying stocks/forex  CT accounts going quiet  Bull/bear market trend traders don't know what to do
1046719977665921024 2018-10-01 07:14:24 EDT <Crypto_Bitlord> You don’t need to be an expert to understand a big move is coming to bitcoin.  If we break $5800 expect panic all the way down to 4Ks, very quickly.  If it launches through $6700 obviously $7300.  -People are still charging for this kind of advice.
